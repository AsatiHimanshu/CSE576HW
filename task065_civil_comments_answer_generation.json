Let us hope that the two children will recover, that they really did suffer only non-\u00ad\u00adlife-threatening injuries.\n\nBut I suggest your editors file this story not under \"Accidents\" but rather under \"Crashes.\" The former term suggests a lack of clear causation. In this case, it appears the driver was reckless (i.e., was at fault or the cause of the incident), accelerating into the two apparently without seeing or at least looking out for them. Also the driver was cited for driving without a license. And there is a possibility that meth might be a factor. All of this suggests clear causes for the event.

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex?
