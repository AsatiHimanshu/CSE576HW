To be noted is  that President Obama, in his just concluded visit to Viet Nam, lifted earlier restrictions on selling lethal weaponry to that country, a move widely interpreted as boosting Vietnamese capacity to respond to PRC incursions and a signal to the Chinese that the US does not intend to back down from its \"pivot.\" As the author points out, however, it is a hasty mis-step on the part of a lower level actor in the region, a Chinese pilot or an American captain, that could spell real trouble. Nevertheless, given the comparative levels of discipline in the US Navy and the People's Liberation Army, it seems more likely that such an incident could arise from a hothead on the Chinese side - then the question would be \"how would the US respond?\"",

Why would I buy or rent a movie when I can see it online for a fraction of the cost or free? Such (I think) is the fate of dispensaries. The 25% tax just exacerbates the business challenges.\n\nMy guess is that dispensaries will be visited by first time consumers who don't have of other options or for convenience in a pinch if one's jar is temporarily empty, but not for an ongoing supply.

As I headed to the men's room there was a commotion in the ladies' room. A transgender guy dressed as a female prostitute in a very short skirt was in the ladies room shaving his legs at the sink to prepare for the evening. He had no underwear on so his junk was clearly visible as he had one foot up on the sink. This was all apparently no big deal to him, but a female patron had complained to the owner, who was confronting the guy and holding the ladies' room door open as I walked by. I figured, wow, so that's what goes on in San Francisco. Now this will be coming to a ladies' room near you and your young daughters, minus the confrontation.
