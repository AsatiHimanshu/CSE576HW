EC farm policies now swallow\ntwo-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion European\ncurrency units (Ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected\nshortfall this year of about five billion Ecus.\n    The most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils\nand fats tax and a change in the \"green\" exchange rate system,\nwhich translates EC farm prices into national currencies.\n    The tax, of up to 330 Ecus per tonne, would be levied on\nimported and domestically produced oilseeds, but could trigger\na fresh trade dispute with the United States, which provides\nthe EC with the bulk of its soybeans.\n    It would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat\nproducts in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter\nconsumption.\n    West Germany has flatly rejected green rate changes, which\nwould cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with\nweak and strong currencies were brought more into line.\n REUTER\n",

This carries data internally\nwithin the PC.\n    The company said the new bus offers processing power up to\ntwo to three-and-a-half times the existing IBM PC AT.\n    IBM said the new PC's can run a new operating system,\ncalled IBM DOS Version 3.3, which is now available.\n    The company also said it will offer a second operating\nsystem, called IBM Operating System/2, developed jointly with\nMicrosoft Corp &lt;MSFT>. This will be available in stages,\nbeginning in the first quarter of 1988.\n    IBM said Operating System/2 will for the first time give\nIBM PC users the ability to access multiple applications and\nvery large programs and amounts of data.\n    IBM said said its Personal System/2 Model 30, which is an\nIntel 8-megahertz (MHz) 8086-based system, is now available at\na list price of 1,695 dlrs each with two diskette drives and\nfor 2,295 dlrs with one diskette and one 20-megabyte fixed disk\ndrive. The unit weighs 17 pounds.\n    It said an 8087 math coprocessor that runs at the same\neight MHz rate as the 8086 is available.\n    The company said the Personal System/2 Model 50, an Intel\n10 MHz 80286-based desktop system, is now available at a cost\nof 3,595 dlrs.\n    IBM said said its Personal System/2 Model 60, which is also\nan Intel 10 MHz 80286-based system, is a floor-standing system\navailable in two configurations. This system, which is\nscheduled for availability in the second quarter, lists at\n5,295 dlrs with a 44MB fixed disk drive and 6,295 dlrs on the\n70MB fixed disk drive.\n    The company said the Personal System/2 80 is the most\npowerful member of the new family of PC's, using an Intel\n80386-based mocroprocessor. The floor-standing machine will be\navailable in three configurations.\n    IBM said one Model 80 configuration, scheduled for July\navailability at a cost of 6,995 dlrs, runs at 16 MHz, contains\n1MB of memory and features a 44MB fixed disk drive.\n    A second configuration, also scheduled for July at 8,495\ndlrs each, runs at 16 MHz and has 2MB of memory and a 70MB\nfixed disk drive.\n    The company said the third Model 80 is scheduled for the\nfourth quarter and features IBM-designed one-megabit memory\ntechnology. Expected to cost 10,995 dlrs, it runs at 20 MHz and\nfeatures 2MB of memory and a 115 MB fixed disk drive.\n   \n    IBM said its Personal System/2 incorporates enhanced\nintegrated graphics functions including significantly improved\ntext, expanded colors up to 256 out of a palette of more than\n256,000, and sharper business graphics.\n    The company said the Models 50, 60 and 80 Video Graphics\nArray supports 640 x 480 x 16 colors in graphics mode and 720 x\n400 x 16 colors in text mode. It will also support the new 320\nx 200 x 256 color mode.\n    With the addition of the new advanced graphics feature, IBM\nsaid, 1024 x 768 addressability also can be obtained.\n Reuter\n",

The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on\nthe Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.\n    \"We haven't had a strike on the seaway for years...a\nprolonged strike would have a disasterous effect,\" Seaway\nAuthority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.\n    \"These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the\nSt Lawrence Seaway,\" George Miller, vice-president of the\nCanadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of major\nCanadian shipping companies, said recently.\n    The workers' current contract expires May 31. The\nassociation said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages\nfor the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power to\nrestructure crew dispatching.\n    The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs\n(U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and\nfreight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985\nwas its worst year in two decades.\n    Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on\nthe Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to last\nyear's 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tolls\nthroughout the rest of the waterway.\n    Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway's 15 locks and\nabout 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.\n    \"We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we\nwon't see a major increase for a number of years,\" Hemsley said.\n    A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers\nin Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this\nseason but the full benefits won't be felt for several years,\nBlair said.\n Reuter\n",

But they would be given a much\ngreater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert\nHeller, who joined the board last August.\n    He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but\nargues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were\nadopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the\nvolatility of exchange rates.\n    Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of\ncommodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.\n    His idea, which many conservative economists find\nappealing, has some backing among board members appointed in\nrecent years by President Reagan.\n    It would complement the present system of opening or\nclosing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,\nkey indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of\nthe money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to\nchanges in interest rates and affect economic activity\ndirectly.\n    Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept\nis part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary\npolicy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid\nbase.\n    \"What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can\nserve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary\npurposes,\" says Heller.\n    In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States\nwent off the gold standard because the global economy had\nvastly outstripped gold supplies.\n    A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of\nhand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest\nproducers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa.\n    The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early\n1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.\n    But the current system of floating currencies in which\ncurrencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the\nmonetary system, is also being widely questioned.\n    Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a\nformal approach that mandates intervention by countries when\ncurrencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are\nmajor problems with this also.\n    For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries\nmight be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be\ndetrimental to their own domestic economy.\n    Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can\nmake much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree\nwith the fundamental judgement.\n    The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference\nto work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them\ncope with their overpowering debt problems.\n    Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's\nchief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called\nGroup of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a\nforum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other\neconomic matters.\n   He appears convinced that officials from West Germany,\nFrance, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind\nclosed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public\nposturing.\n   The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a\nprofound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and\ninternational exchange rates.\n    As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major\ncommodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together\nand prices would be measured on a regular basis.\n    \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might\nbe tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary\npolicy might be eased,\" he says.\n    He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction\nmarkets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a\nvirtually continuous basis.\n    Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and\ntraded on a world-wide basis, so \"that an index has a relevance\nfor the entire world,\" he says.\n    In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the\nproduction chain and serve as an imput into virtually all\nproduction processes.\n    \"Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive\nindicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures,\nthe monetary authorities may take such an index into account in\nmaking their monetary policy decisions,\" he says.\n    However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity\nsuch as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by\nthe OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system.\n    He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow\nmonetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity\nto the rest of the system and to other commodities.\n Reuter\n",

But she said by June worries about a freeze\nin Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor,\nwith prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time.\n    A trader at a major international trade house, who asked\nnot to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but\nbelieves if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high\nexport price and requires a high contribution quota from\nexporters the market could steady at the lower levels.\n    Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on\nBrazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new\ninternational agreement could come into force next fall.\n    Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen\nfrom about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb\ntoday, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and\ndemand.\n    Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of\nstocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will\nneed to do some buying soon.\n    \"Most producing nations have just completed or are about to\ncomplete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at\ntheir seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and\nwarehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly\noverburdened,\" said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson\nLehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report.\n    Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency to\nservice foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell,\nand \"this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to\nundertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows.\"\n    Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before\nBrazil's frost season begins in June.\n    Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by,\nthough analysts note the peak winter consumption period is\npassed and demand usually slows this time of year.\n    Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of\nJanuary 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags\ncompared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown\nfor the usually busy winter roasting season.\n    But Elders O'Neill said, \"The roasters are not overstocked\nby any means.\"\n    Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult,\ngiven the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory\nbelow the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several\ntraders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short\nterm.\n Reuter\n",

Those\namendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because\nthe House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall\njurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them,\nCongressional sources said.\n    The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the\nlife of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than\nthe current three years through fiscal 1988.\n    The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., also\nwould increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from\n1.5 billion now.\n    Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by\nRep.

The amendment, offered\nby Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at\ncurbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and\nforeign foods containing dairy products.

Discussions\nwith up to a dozen other airlines have not yet resulted in\npublic commitments.\n    Apart from a shortage of orders, Airbus also is facing an\nuphill struggle persuading its member governments to fund the\n2.5 billion dlr project, which involves not only the A340 but\nits sister A330 aircraft, a twin engined, wide bodied medium\nrange jet with many identical components.\n    The British government remains unconvinced that there will\nbe sufficient room in the world long range jet market.\n    The West German government is also uncommitted, and is\ncurrently pressing for a restructuring of the consortium's West\nGerman company, &lt;Deutsche Airbus GmbH>, while only the French\ngovernment appears to be fully behind the program.\n    Another major factor delaying a final decision on the plane\nhas been the engine which will power it. Airbus agreed last\nOctober with &lt;CFM International> that its CFM-56 engine with\n28,600 lbs of thrust would power the plane. But in December,\nAirbus announced an agreement with CFM rival &lt;International\nAero Engine> (IAE) to power a slightly larger version of the\nA340 with a 30,000 lb thrust high-technology superfan engine.\n   Airbus has made clear to potential customers that the IAE\nengine is now the principle engine for the project.  The\nincorporation of the superfan engine made the plane on paper\nmore attractive to airlines, but the engine has yet to be\ndeveloped and CFM International had openly expressed scepticism\nthat the engine will be ready when the plane goes into service.\n    The future of the Airbus consortium depends on the right\ndecision being made on the A340 in the next few weeks, for it\ncould find itself severely exposed in the 1990s either by\nstaying absent from the long range jet market or by committing\nitself to a commercially unviable project.\n REUTER\n",

The TWA offer was announced shortly\nafter the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.\n    TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It\nalso said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and\nthreatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer\nfor 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.\n    TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for\nUSAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said\nit alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the\nairlines.\n    Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman\nCarl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into\nthe takeover arena.\n    \"We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA\ninto play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to\nmove onto somthing else,\" said one arbitrager. \"We think TWA\nmight just be putting up a trial balloon.\"\n    Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,\nbut that the airline will probably reject it because the price\nis relatively low compared to other airline deals.\n    They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by\nrevealing financing arrangements. \"They need to show their\ncommitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a\ncredible offer,\" said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.\n    \"I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values\nof airline deals,\" said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would\nbe in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.\n    USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A\nspokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not\nchanged its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of\nthat airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance\nfor 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.\n    USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln\nshares.\n    Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also\nremained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding\n65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.\n    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with\nits offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont\nand opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover\nof Piedmont.\n    Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to\nmake his own airline a more attractive takeover target.\n    \"Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there\nwere no takers. I think the strategy might have called for\nmaking his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish\nthat specific objective is to go out and acquire other\nairlines,\" said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.\n    \"I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this\nway it becomes a much more viable package,\" said Kim.\n    But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction\nremains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load.\n    Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do\nthe offer.\n    The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial\nadvisers and plans to make his own arrangements.\n   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X>\nand still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.\n    Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was\nimpacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham\nLambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal.\n    Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA\noffer on price and financing concerns. \"It's littered with\ncontingencies and it doesn't even have a financing\narrangement,\" said one executive at another major airline.\n    But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a\nstrong contender with USAir's east coast route system and\nplanned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the\nintenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in\nits St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,\nto the mix would develop an even stronger force.\n    The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation\nsystem.\n    Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would\nresult in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.\n   \n Reuter\n",

That is in\nfact what has happened since Paris.\"\n    Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by\nthe decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and\ncease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.\n    Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but\nleft room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.\n    The official refused to comment, however, on whether the\nagreement included a secret pact to consider further\ncoordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations\nhave taken jointly several times in the past year.\n    On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,\nFrance, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were\nwithin ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic\nconditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget\ndeficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.\n    The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future\ninternational talks.\n    \"I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand\npolitically and the stronger he is politically the better off\nwe are with the Congress and the better off we are in\ninternational fora,\" said the official, an Administration\neconomic policymaker. \"So it would be beneficial to the\ncontinued conduct of our initiatives.\"\n    But the official also said the Administration would resist\ncalls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target\nEuropeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.\n    Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret \nshort-term target ranges for their currencies with a specific\nagreement to defend those bands with intervention.\n    According to market sources, the ranges agreed were 1.60 to\n1.90 marks to the dollar, and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar.\n    There is no official confirmation that specific bands  were\nset, although the agreement used the term \"ranges\", for the first\ntime in an international economic agreement.\n    The Paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to\nfoster currency stability around current levels.\n    Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to\nstop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached\n1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to\nhave intervened to curb sterling's strength.\n    International monetary sources say finance ministers and\ncentral bankers, who will review market performance and their\nown economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington\njust before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the\nInternational Monetary Fund.\n    The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris\npact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.\n    Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,\nwhile U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to\nshow that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.\n    Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently\nwhen Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told\nbankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if\nthe Fed was ready to follow suit.\n    A Reagan Administration official said this would show there\nhad been some change in approach on the part of the central\nbank in Germany.\n    But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by\nthe Fed and the Bundesbank.\n    \"If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked\nabout it, it would no longer be private,\" said the official, who\nasked not to be identified.\n    Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank\nis keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the\nmajor economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S.\nTrade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated\naction could be on the April agenda.\n REUTER\n",

The shares climbed 3-3/8 to 31-3/8 by midday.\nVoytko said profit-taking pressure could become severe at the\n35 dlr level. Others say Conrail, a combination of previously\nbankrupt railroads, has good long term potential.\n    \"Conrail is in the best position to weather the current\ntremendous price competition in the transportation industry in\ngeneral,\" said Drew Robertson, analyst at Atlantic Systems Inc,\na research firm.\n    \"It will survive and do damn well,\" said another analyst\nwho declined to be identified. He noted that Conrail's freight\ntrains serve heavy industry including steel and autos in major\nU.S. cities in the northeast U.S. and midwest.\n    Robertson noted that Conrail's traffic is less dependent on\ncoal than other railroads based in the east. He expects Conrail\nto earn 2.85 dlrs per share in 1987.\n    Voytko of PaineWebber sees another problem six months down\nthe road when more than 10 mln Conrail shares will be\ndistributed to current and former employees. He believes many\nof these indivdiuals will be inclined to sell the stock.\n    Robertson says it's hard to determine the psychology of the\naverage employe, but even if a lot of stock is sold, it would\nwould not hit the market as one big block. He doubts it would\ncreate a big downward push on the price.\n    \"It's hard to call,\" said the analyst who requested\nanonymity. In some cases employe loyalty may motivate\nindividuals to keep their shares, he said.\n    Steven Lewins, analyst for Citicorp Investment Management,\nbelieves the key to Conrail's long term outlook is how it is\nable to invest surplus cash. He expects Conrail to earn 3.00\ndlrs per share this year, flat in comparison with 1986, but by\n1991 the picture could change dramatically if money not needed\nfor rail operations is invested wisely.\n    By 1991, earnings could reach 4.30 dlrs per share, Lewins\nsaid, factoring in reinvestment of free cash flow at\nconservative rates.\n    He believes motor freight will be one area of\ndiversification Conrail will explore.\n    Elizabeth Dole, U.S. Secretary of Transportation, whose\ndepartment was responsible for the sale of Conrail, noted that\nConrail is required to reinvest in its rail system and cannot\ndefer necessary maintenance.\n    For the historic offering of Conrail shares, Dole visited\nthe New York Stock Exchange and was photographed on the floor\nwearing a locomotive engineer's cap, which she presented to\nStanley Crane, Conrail chairman and chief executive.\n    The U.S. government is expected to receive about 1.88\nbillion dlrs for Conrail after factoring in underwriting fees\nand other adjustments.\n    The possibility of a recession at some time in the next\nfive years is another issue troubling some investors.\n    Lewins says revenue-ton-miles, which he believes will climb\nfrom 68.7 mln miles last year to 69.5 mln this year and 70.5\nmln in 1988, will grow to 71.5 mln in 1991, but in a recession\nyear, perhaps 1989, the figure could dip to 64.2 mln.\n    On the revenue side, he believes revenue per ton-mile will\nbe 4.7 cts in 1991, little changed from present levels and\nexactly the same as in 1981.\n    \"Their basic business isn't going anywhere,\" he says,\nexplaining why emphasizes investment of cash flow.\n    Voytko thinks Conrail can remain profitable in a recession\nyear. He points out his firm, PaineWebber, is not forecasting a\nrecession in any specific year, but as an example a 1990\nrecession of modest degree could knock earnings down to 2.20\ndlrs per share. He estimated 3.00 dlrs per share this year and\n3.35 dlrs next year. His 1988 figure reflects mostly a lowering\nof the tax rate to 34 pct from 40 pct this year.\n    Voytko believes the Conrail shares merit purchase at the 26\ndlr level.\n    Goldman, Sachs and Co was lead manager for the offering.

He did not say how much of a price hike he expected.\n     Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted\nthat world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20\ndlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in\n1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb\nfrom a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between\n1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.\n     \"Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in\nincreased demand,\" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry's\noutlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law\nprohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants\nand utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15\npct, he said.\n     Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may\nexperience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next\nwinter because of the industry's reduced deliverability.\n     Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20\npct during 1986, he said.\n     \"This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,\" Nance said.\n\"We believe gas prices have bottomed out.

The discussion is\nnow on pricing (of just the cash payments),\" he said.\n    Foreign banking sources in Manila said on Tuesday that the\nPhilippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 7/8\nover the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) but Ongpin would\nnot discuss details of the pricing negotiations.\n    He also refused to speculate on when an overall agreement\nmight be reached. The talks have been going on for more than\nthree weeks.\n    Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8\nover LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs -- tradeable,\ndollar-denominated, zero coupon notes that could potentially\nyield up to one point over LIBOR.\n    The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee at\nleast a 7/8 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still had\ngrave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for other\nlarge debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.\n    The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as a\nseparate option for those banks, which might want to fund their\nown investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in the\nsecondary market, Ongpin said.\n    Under Manila's plan, the PINs would be redeemable at full\nface value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investments\nat any time prior to their six-year maturity date.\n    While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINs\nproposal, Ongpin said there was great interest on the part of\ncertain investment banks which are already active in the\nsecondary market for sovereign debt.\n    Unlike current debt/equity schemes, Ongpin said, the PINs\nwould include no government fees and would be free from\n\"administrative hassles.\"\n    He said about six investment banks had been approached and\nfour had replied so far. One even showed interest in buying 45\nmln dlrs worth of notes, he said.\n    Ongpin said that by funding current interest payments in\nthe secondary market through the PINs scheme, the Philippines\ncould conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreign\nexchange reserves during its planned seven-year restructuring\nperiod.\n REUTER\n",

Midland shares were up 14p at 633p.\n    Midland said its 1986 results included Crocker National\nCorp for the first five months, prior to its sale last May. If\nresults were restated excluding distortions stemming from the\nCrocker sale they would show a 1986 pre-tax profit of 432 mln\nstg compared with 366 mln, it said.\n    Barron said that after the sale of Crocker and\nrestructuring during the last two years the group had \"put the\npast firmly behind us in 1986\" and was now \"focusing our\nconsiderable resources on the exciting opportunities ahead.\"\n    Chief Executive Sir Kit McMahon said U.K. Operations were\nthe main source of profits, with 83 pct or 434 mln stg.\n    Both net interest income and non-interest income were ahead\nof 1985.\n    A key component in domestic asset growth was a 96 pct rise\nin Midland's mortgage portfolio to 2.7 billion stg, comfortably\nexceeding a 2.5 billion target, McMahon said. Overall sterling\nadvances rose over 18 pct to 20.2 billion stg.\n    Pre-tax profits in investment banking rose 27 pct to 65 mln\nstg despite the heavy start-up and integration costs. However,\nthis included the group's full range of activities in this area\nfrom its treasuries operations to its merchant bank to\nsecurities and gilts trading activities.\n    No breakdown of this figure was given although McMahon said\nventure capital activites contributed 17 mln stg to profit. He\nsaid the group's gilts trading was operating at a profit\nalthough its securities activities were not, but would give no\nfurther details.\n    International banking profits rose 80 pct to 54 mln stg,\nbenefitting from past restructuring and good performances from\nEuropean subsidiaries.\n    Crocker and the Bracton subsidiary created by Midland to\nwork out Crocker's problem loans made a loss of 44 mln stg in\n1986 against a 35 mln loss in 1985.\n    Bracton assets now stood at 300 mln dlrs and had been fully\nprovisioned, McMahon said.\n    Charges for bad and doubtful debts declined to 357 mln stg\nagainst 431 mln the previous year and the bank said that\nexcluding Crocker, it would have been 320 mln.\n    McMahon noted that total cover for bad debts had increased\nto three pct of lendings in 1986 from 2.6 pct in 1985. He said\nno evidence of increasing consumer credit delinquency and fewer\nU.K. Corporate defaults allowed for a lower domestic debt\ncharge in 1986.\n    McMahon said Midland's exposure in South America remained\nunchanged on 1985, with 1.4 billion stg outstanding to Brazil,\n1.3 billion to Mexico and 600 mln to Argentina.\n    Following the lead of the other four major U.K. Banks\nMidland moved charges against lending to rescheduling countries\nfrom general to specific provisions.\n    This was the key factor behind a reduction in its tax rate\nto just under 40 pct in 1986 from 59 pct in 1985, McMahon said.\n    One major problem still to be faced by the bank was to\nfurther reduce its cost/income ratio, which is still well above\nits competitors at 72 pct, he added.\n REUTER\n&#3;\n\n",
