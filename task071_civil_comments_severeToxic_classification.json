Let alone, she admitted to assisting with drugging the girls in order to let her husband rape and molest them! This whole thing is disgusting! Not to mention he used to also work and is good family friends with Dr. Mackie who is no longer allowed to practice after the DEA busted him for being apart of an OxyContin ring.. She is just as sick as him to bring these girls into her home as a sex object for her husband! Fucking sick that the state would be willing to look over that.",

The bullet ricocheted off the trunk and out the window in the direction of people standing outside.  One of his fellow CATM members once thought he had cleared his weapon and so pulled the trigger.  He was in his truck and I think he shot his radio.  You'd think an AF Cop would know how to drive, but one hit me on Elmendorf AFB causing $5k in damage.  Military can be very stupid too.",
