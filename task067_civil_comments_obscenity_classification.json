Reinbold paid $850 in rent plus $100 in utilities, a total of $950/month. Rep. Vasquez paid $650 in rent, plus $100 in utilities, a total of $750.

The cornerstone of his plan is fairness.  I know this first hand; I spoke to him about it myself.\n\nThen, the Body, which created the fiscal mess, comes back with SB128- putting the fiscal burden on every man, woman, and CHILD in the state. PFD reform is not a good stand alone answer. The public will not abide a PFD raid; perceived or real!\n\nTo make matters worse, the Governor applauds the enemy when he needs to go right back for support to his strongest constituency, the general public and demand a better fiscal plan.\n\nThis constitutes a sad political strategy to shift the blame from the GOP, to the governor.\n\nPaybacks are a bitch",

Then there are people like my Chickasaw grandpa, a dead end leech who drank heavily. There isn't a program out there that will ever save his kind. They need to be removed from society, prison, just like my grandfather, so they cannot inflict their criminal dysfunction on society. what few understand is drugs/alcohol are not the problem, they merely exacerbate what already exists.",
