(My best guesstimate based on what I know of the cost and coverage for state employees, assuming LCC workers are receiving a similar or better plan.) That leaves workers paying approximately $1400 a year in premiums, which they can offset using $1100 in flex spending, leaving them responsible for just $340 PER YEAR/ $28 PER MONTH in health care costs. Even with the increase in costs of 16.5%, the workers are still receiving excellent coverage for themselves and their FAMILIES for just $1276 PER YEAR, which would be less than what LCC contributes for a single MONTH with the added 16.5%.

These sources provided an understanding of the early Church as a communion of local Churches, with the bishop as the focus of unity, sharing a common faith but with a certain diversity of practice in a society that was largely pagan. Discovery of documents from the early patristic period in the late 19th-C contributed to a renewed understanding of the episcopate necessitating a re-evaluation of the relationship between bishops and in particular the bishop of Rome.
