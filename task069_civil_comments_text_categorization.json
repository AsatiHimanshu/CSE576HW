Bigotry is what you do in light of different beliefs, not the harboring of different beliefs itself.

Historically, that is 1968 minimum wage level was the highest ever, in terms of its actual purchasing power.  However, here's the point, and the record is clear: quite soon after the minimum wage is raised, there's an immediate surge in inflation, which works to erode the increase in purchasing power, even totally negate that bump in the dollar wage.  Economists can make a pretty good case that the huge inflation rates we began to see in the early 1970s were triggered by that 1968 bump in the minimum wage.  Inflation is a great enemy of wage earners.  It destroys purchasing power.  Meanwhile, the \"Big Boys\" get to use price increases, and be ahead.",

Our governments and the market have thus far failed to stem displacement in our rapidly gentrifying city, and we continue to lack the tools necessary to increase density in a way that accounts for displacement.

Wheelchair or no wheelchair, the person has to get themselves to the tow yard (which does not have wheelchair access).\n\nLed by Senator Avel Gordly, the legislature enacted important new citizen protections against predatory towing effective January 1, 2008, but there is no effective way for Portlanders to learn what their rights are other than what the predatory towers themselves tell you. A description of the protections has never appeared on the City website. The version posted there has never been correct.\n\nIt is only in the past two years the the City began enforcing the signage requirements, and the City Towing Coordinator worked with the towers to pass the costs onto the citizens. $ 20 of every tow bill goes to the towers to \"compensate\" them for their signs, with no upper limit, and your $ 20 is likely to be paying for signs completely unrelated to the place your vehicle was towed from.\n\nPortland towers are allowed to operate in open violation of state law and the City's own statutes, providing towing services to property owners for free. That is specifically prohibited by state law and City ordinance.\n\nSenator Gordly's legislation was intended to protect people living in apartment complexes, generally low-income, minority populations, and they have no one standing up for them in City Hall.

If so that would suggest a correlation between violent crimes and use of force -- people who commit violence are more likely to be targets of force in jail.

Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show. \n\nProduction values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars.

Bill Naito was widely recognized for taking on ventures that were at least as beneficial to the community as they were potentially moneymaking. In 1981 he built the 300-unit McCormick Pier Apartments along the waterfront, replacing a derelict warehouse district and providing needed middle-income housing in an area where other developers had concluded it could not succeed.\nThe company sold the property in 2002 to a developer who successfully converted the apartments into condominiums. \nNaito Parkway is named for a responsible developer who had a great influence on Portland\u2019s growth into a unique and desirable city.\nRef:\nbit.ly/23xnfC9\nRef:\nbit.ly/23xnD3L",
