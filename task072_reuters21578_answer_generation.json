Western Kansas was hardest hit while Eastern Kansas\nonly had rain, he said.\n    Paul Johnston of the Nebraska Livestock Feeders Association\nsaid, \"There's no question that baby calves coming in that kind\nof blizzard are probably not going to make it.\"\n    We were having such a nice winter and the cows were out\ncalving before the storm hit, he added.\n    The worst part of the storm came through the center of the\nstate. Precipitation was generally in the form of wet snow and\nsome feedlots are already like \"soup\", he said, inhibiting\ncattle movements.\n    The storm also had an effect on weight gain of larger\nanimals. Drifting snow caused problems in moving feed and mud\nmade it hard for cattle to reach the feed once it was\navailable.\n    Domer noted that feedyards sources say a tremendous cutback\nhas occurred in feed consumption by cattle in the yards, which\nmay or may not lead to sickness over the next several days.\nCattle reduced daily feed consumption to about 12 lbs from 25\nduring the worst of the blizzard, he said.\n    Mud will be more a problem as the weather breaks and snow\nmelts. Mud adds to stress on full-grown animals and endangers\nsmaller ones which can fall and be trampled in pens. The cost\nof feeding rises as animals generally consume more in cold\nweather, Domer said.\n    Domer said it will be at least 10 days before yards get\nback to normal.\n    Roy Gallant, from Accu Weather Services, said that although\nthe worst of the storm is over, there are still some strong\ngusty winds which will not diminish until tonight.\n    The storm started late Sunday night in West Kansas and is\njust now winding down. The storm has moved into South Dakota,\nparts of Minnesota and Eastern North Dakota, he said.\n    Snow accumulations from the storm totaled six to 10 inches\nin most sections and 12 to 18 in a few spots before moving\nnorth. This equals 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches of water. Drifts of four\nto six feet and up to 12 feet were reported, he said.\n    There's a possibility of another storm brushing that region\ntomorrow night and Friday, Gallant added.\n Reuter\n",

Chairman\nAllan Hawkins said last week that BIL's actions were aimed only\nat dirsrupting the merger and were not in the interests of\nProgressive shareholders.\n    Both Rainbow's and Progressive's boards have approved the\nmerger proposal. It has also been approved by the Commerce\nCommission, but BIL's bid is still subject to the Commission's\nscrutiny.\n    Progressive shares ended at 4.35 dlrs, Rainbow at 3.42 and\nBIL at 4.17 at the close of New Zealand Stock Exchange trading\ntoday.\n REUTER\n",

They worry that\nthis could further reduce the industry's shrinking deposit\nbase.\n    This has given added urgency to bank moves to build up\ntheir capital market operations as Turkey's market-oriented\nPrime Minister Turgut Ozal liberalises the financial system.\n    Bankers said the 1986 recovery in earnings stemmed partly\nfrom foreign exchange operations and trade finance. But a\ngrowing volume of trading in government securities is now also\na major source of revenue for banks.\n    Bankers said the proportion of bank profits generated from\nthe traditional financing of commerce and industry is falling,\nand some have even been making a loss on these operations.\n    The major challenge to bank profits in Turkey came in 1980\nwhen the government, faced with its worst financial crisis in\n50 years, raised domestic interest rates sharply to fight an\ninflation rate of over 100 pct and launched an export drive.\n    Deniz Gokce, associate professor of economics at the\nBosphorus University, told Reuters that banks were forced to\npay depositors real interest rates for the first time and\nprofits started to fall. Previously, rates had been below\ninflation.\n    Turkey's domestic banks also partly missed out on the\nexport drive as foreign banks moved into Istanbul and reaped\nthe benefits of trade finance with their added expertise. The\nnumber of foreign banks has risen to 16 from just two in 1981.\n    Although local banks tried to follow suit, Turkey's exports\ndeclined last year to 7.4 billion dlrs from 7.9 billion in 1985\nand bankers doubt there is enough business to go round.\n    As a result banks, including a few foreign operations, have\nstarted moving into capital market operations to broaden their\nearnings base and take advantage of the relaunch just over a\nyear ago of the Istanbul Stock Exchange.\n    \"When we saw that there was a demand and supply of money\noutside the banking system, we could not envisage ourselves\nexcluded from these transactions,\" said Osman Erk, deputy\ngeneral manager of the private bank Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi AS.\n    The number of banks active at the exchange, mainly trading\ngovernment securities, went up to 28 this year from 23 when the\nmarket was revived in December 1985.\n    Liberalisation went one step further last week when\nparliament passed a law encouraging companies to go public.\nLast month, Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi launched the country's first\ncommercial paper programme, for a joint-venture chemical firm.\n    Medium-sized private Pamukbank AS announced a strong\nrecovery in 1986 pre-tax profit to 12.9 billion lira from 603\nmln in 1985, while Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi profits increased to\n30.6 billion lira from 6.1 billion. Bankers said both benefited\nfrom trade finance and increased capital market operations.\n    Turkey's second biggest bank, the private Turkiye Is\nBankasi, announced a profit rise to 35 billion from 32.3\nbillion in 1985.\n    However, bankers said some banks have been \"window dressing\"\ntheir balance sheets to mask non-performing loans which are\nvariously estimated by bankers at between 20 to 50 pct of the\nindustry's 9,026 billion lira in total credits.\n    Non-performing loans began to mount in the early 1980s as\nindustry failed to cope with higher interest rates and started\nto default. Some banks continued to count loans as performing.\n    \"After 1984 all banks started to be more careful in giving\ncredits, so the non-performing loans is a problem of the period\nbetween 1980 to 1984,\" Erk said.\n    But the problem of bad loans led to a rescue by three state\nbanks of medium-sized Turkiye Ogretmenler Bankasi AS earlier\nthis year when the Treasury, which acts as a watchdog body over\nbanks, discovered that the its assets were to a large extent\nmade up of non-performing loans.\n    Some 51 billion lira out of the bank's 69 billion lira loan\nportfolio was non-performing. But the bank had reported a 1986\npre-tax profit of 65 mln lira.\n    Bankers cited this as a typical example of how balance\nsheets could hide problems despite a drive by the central bank\nto standardise accounting.\n    Gokce said the only solution would be for compulsory\nauditing by international accounting companies.\n REUTER\n",

We went everywhere\non foot. The land here is salty, so the harvests were not good.\nMoney and food were inadequate. When it rained, the water\nleaked through the grass roof,\" said Li Wenxian, 31, of Hongshan\nin Zhejiang. Now he and other villagers live in large\ntwo-storey concrete homes with balconies and courtyards.\n    But still they face formidable difficulties. Many rural\nfactories are unable to get the raw materials they need, or\nelse they find they have become too expensive.\n    Gao Jianming, an official of Zhejiang's Rural Industry\ndepartment, said Zhejiang firms scour China for raw materials,\nwhich sometimes they barter for finished goods.\n    The People's Daily this month reported about 60 pct of\nChina's rural factories operate below capacity because of power\nshortages. It said many rural factories lose money because of\nthese problems and difficulties in getting credit, poor quality\nof goods and competition from larger state firms.\n    \"Electricity is short. In the busiest periods on the farms\nthe factories work three to four days a week so that\nagriculture can have all the power it needs. But more power is\navailable at night or on Sundays,\" Gao said.\n    Rural factories mostly operate outside official plans,\nwhich allocate raw materials under quota at cheap prices to\nstate firms. They have to compete on the open market for raw\nmaterials whose prices are driven up by demand.\n    Li said Hongshan does not suffer from power shortages only\nbecause its cement factory provides cheap cement to the\nelectricity supply department.\n    The raw materials of Hongshan's cement have to come\nhundreds of miles from central China by rail or canal, while\nits textile factories buy fabric from the far northeast.\n    The industrialisation of rural China began in the late\n1970s, a key part of top leader Deng Xiaoping's economic\nreforms. Deng wanted to harness the manpower of the\ncountryside, but keep it there and not draw it to the cities.\n    Hongshan set up factories and businesses because there was\nnot enough work on the land for its 3,700 people. Now just 120\nof its workers work full-time on the land. The rest work in 23\nfactories making cement, plastics and textiles.\n    The transformation of the rural economy is most noticeable\nalong the eastern seaboard where communications are good,\nlabour plentiful, land fertile and large markets nearby.\n    Gao said rural factories in Zhejiang now employ 25 pct of\nthe province's labour force. In 1985 such factories, for the\nfirst time, produced more in value than the province's farms.\n    \"The industrialising process is not over. When our farms are\nmore mechanised, and not many are now, more labour will become\navailable. There is a very big potential,\" Gao said.\n    Rural industry in Zhejiang has grown by more than 20 pct a\nyear since 1980, faster than any other sector of the economy.\n    Goods from Hongshan's factories are sold all over China.\n    Villager Li said when Hongshan started building factories\nin 1975 it was illegal, but local leaders approved it on\ncondition no state money was invested.\n    \"We borrowed money to start our cement factory and have\nrelied on our own resources since then,\" he said.\n    Another worker in a Hongshan tea-growing collective said\nbefore rural industrialisation there was no point in working\nhard, because most people earned the same.\n    \"The laziest in the commune used to laugh at those of us who\nworked more, but got the same,\" she said.\n REUTER\n",

The dollar was sold anyway.\n    Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris\naccord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said.\n    The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul\nVolcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita,\nwhich a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a\nhalt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they\nnoted.\n    The situation has again raised the question of whether\nintervention can succeed against the trend in today's huge\ncurrency markets. Dealers said the market's cool response to\nintervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars.\n    \"This means that the current dollar selling is not of a\nsheer speculative nature but backed by real demand,\" said Koichi\nMiyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank.\n    Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the\nintervention and it is only a matter of time before some\noperators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed in\nTokyo today at 149.40 against New York's 149.30/40. Its record\nlow was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday.\n    Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to\nrise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven\nindustrial nations meets to discuss currencies again.\n    The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plus\nItaly) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies\napart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said.\n    Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be\nused and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris\naccord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing to\nprevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S.\nTrade deficit, especially with Japan.\n    Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for a\nlower dollar is also limiting Washington's options, they said.\n    The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow\nthe dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, said\nTadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.\n    Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large\nforward dollar sales from April to June for export bills\nfalling due for Japanese exporters from April to September.\n    The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen\ndepreciation, dealers said.\n    Yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of\nInternational Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks\nineffective in light of this real demand, they said.\n    The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar\nsales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new\nbusiness year starting April 1, dealers said.\n    \"The market seems to have established a new dollar trading\nrange between 147 and 149 yen,\" one dealer said.\n    The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris\naccord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low\nend for the dollar against the yen, he said.\n    Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148\nyen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to\n145.\n REUTER\n",

Under the pact, Tokyo agreed\nto stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to\nincrease its imports of American semiconductors.\n    Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by\nselling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost\nAmerican imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory\naction.\n    In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese\nchip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost\ndomestic demand and reduce the incentive to export.\n    Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit\ndynamic random access and erasable programmable read only\nmemory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a\ncutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the\nyear.\n    He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of\nchips available for export through unregulated distributors in\nthe so-called grey market.\n    \"We have almost no grey market,\" he said. \"Supply is\ndiminishing.\"\n    To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI\ncalled in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker,\nNEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuing\nspecific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary\nof &lt;Texas Instruments Inc>.\n    Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the\nsteps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for\nU.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers.\n    The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George\nSchultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce Secretary\nMalcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.\n    The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, are\nexpected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker\nMicron Technology Inc &lt;DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales in\nHong Kong.\n    Yamamoto admitted that &lt;Oki Electric Industry Co>'s Hong\nKong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but\ndenied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices.\n    \"If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...We\nwill present our rebuttal,\" he said.\n    The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI's\nadvice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above\nproduction costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said.\n    He also called the case \"strange,\" but he stopped short of\nendorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been\ntrapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micron\npublicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day\nthey were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who\nhad bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.\n Reuter\n",

Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of its\ncopper operations to its shareholders.\n    \"In theory, Phelps is the best stock. It's the purest play\nand benefits most from higher copper prices,\" one said.\n    William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co,\nsaid Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined mining\noperations. \"They've accomplished a great deal,\" he said.\n    The company's move into carbon black, a product used in\ntires, should provide steady earnings, although not rapid\ngrowth, as a hedge against a copper downturn, Siedenburg said.\nHe estimates Phelps will earn 2.45 dlrs in 1987 and 4.45 dlrs\nin 1988, including tax benefits, versus 1.79 dlrs in 1986.\n    Other analysts, including Clarence Morrison of Dean Witter\nReynolds Inc and Merrill's Roling, also recommend Phelps.\n    Morrison projects Phelps will earn 3.25 dlrs in 1987 and\nfour dlrs in 1988, while Roling sees earnings at 2.75 dlrs this\nyear and around 3.50 dlrs next year.\n    \"The stock can go to the mid 30s,\" Roling said, from its\ncurrent level of around 30.

Furthermore,\nRepresentatives of the Farm Credit System, commercial bankers\nand life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree\non a method of establishing the market.\n    Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration,\nFCA, which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said a\nfarm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture\n\"as long as the farm credit system is a key player.\"\n    Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the\nsecondary market could be established either with Congressional\nlegislation or administratively.\n    Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the\nsuccessful resale markets in home mortgages, the Government\nNational Mortgage Association, GNMA, and the Federal Home Loan\nMortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), industry sources said.\n    Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main\nsupporters of a farm loan secondary market since they believe\nit would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in\nrural lending with the quasi-government farm credit system,\ntraditionally the largest lender to farmers.\n    A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell\nhigh-quality loans on farmland to \"poolers,\" who in turn would\npackage the loans and issue farm mortgage-backed securities for\nresale to investors -- called Aggie-mae by some proponents.\n    The FCA and financially-troubled farm credit system have in\nthe past been ambivalent about the idea, mainly because any\nfarm secondary market established in the private sector which\nexcluded the farm credit system would put the system at a\ncompetitive disadvantage and could be another financial blow to\nthe system, which has lost 4.6 billion dlrs in two years,\nNaylor and farm credit system officials have said.\n    However, the system and FCA have become more positive to\nthe idea recently because the system could benefit if it were\nappointed the agent for a secondary market.\n    \"If the farm credit system were the guarantor of the pools\nof farm mortgage loans, it would benefit from the fees charged\nfor providing this service,\" the Life Insurers' study said.\n    Congressional sources believe a secondary market available\nto both private lenders and the farm credit system, with the\nsystem as agent, could be included in a major federal\ngovernment rescue package for the system to be drafted by\nCongress later this year.\n    A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the\nsecondary market idea, the American Council of Life Insurers,\nconcludes that the farm credit system's market share in rural\nlending would fall if a secondary market were established.\n    The study was released earlier today.\n    The study said a secondary market could be established with\nvirtually no federal money if the government provided a\nguarantee of 90 pct of the farm loans but a private\nco-insurance plan guaranteed the first 10 pct of any losses.\n    It estimated between 500 mln and two billion dlrs of the\neight billion in new farm real estate loans issued each year\nwould qualify for the secondary market in the first few years,\nexpanding significantly later as investors accept the idea.\n    The study also said interest rates charged to farmers who\nmeet the underwriting standards of a secondary market would\nfall 50 to 100 basis points due to the new resale market.\n    The possible interest rate declines are a major reason why\nleading U.S. farm organizations such as the American Farm\nBureau Federation have recently endorsed the idea.\n    Proponents say a secondary market also would increase\nliquidity in farm lending, and spread the risk of such loans.\n Reuter\n",

The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory\nfinancing facility and a structural adjustment facility.\n    The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed,\nBolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the\nnext 12 months.\n    Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980,\nopened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris\nClub and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of\nBolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt.\n    Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the\nnegotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be\nfinalised, had been extremely successful.\n    Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule\nBolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and\nhad waived all interest payments until the end of 1988.\n    Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said.\n    Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in\ndisbursements this year from lender countries and international\nagencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put\nthe figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs.\n    Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are\naround 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor\nPaz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the\ncapital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had\nchanged from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net\ninflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986.\n    Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz\nestenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited\ninflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were\nlosing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on\nthe black market at up to 16 times its official rate.\n    Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market-\nrelated rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off\nthousands of workers in state corporations.\n    Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past\nsix months, according to the Central Bank, and the government \nexpects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct\ncontraction over the last six years.\n    The government is also proposing a novel solution to its\ndebt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest\nhas not been paid since March, 1984.\n    Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would\nmake a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at\nthe price it trades on the international secondary market -- \n10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank\nsteering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider\nthe proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the\ncountry's creditor banks will take up the offer.\n    One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to\nbuy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the\ndeal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans\nto the country.\n    But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a\nscheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated\nin Chile for the past two years.\n    The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for\ndebt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to\nprivatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve\nas a basis for such a scheme.\n    Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove\nattractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the\ngovernment realises that it will have to attract a large amount\nof new capital in order to grow.\n    Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters\nthat Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new\ninvestment over the next 10 to 12 years.\n    The government realises that in order to remain viable,\nBolivia will need to develop new exports.\n    The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of\nBolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets,\nand gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundant\nsupply in the region.\n Reuter\n",

It asked the FCC to cut back price and rate regulations\nthat have control its long-distance phone business.\n    ATT spun off its local telephone services operations into\nthe seven regional Bell companies in 1984 as part of the  court\nordered breakup of the telephone giant.\n    The regional companies have been prohibited from\nmanufacturing equipment and from offering information services\nand out-of-region long-distance service.\n    But some of them want to move into those areas,\nparticularly the provision of long-distance services, which\nwould compete directly with ATT.\n    ATT's request came in response to an FCC notice issued in\nJanuary that proposed to streamline regulation of certain parts\nof its long-distance business.\n    The FCC will closely examine the potential effects of the\nproposal on consumers, said FCC spokeswoman Mary Beth Hess.\n    \"That would be foremost in our mind,\" Hess said.\n    Hess said she expected the FCC to respond in a few months.\n    Congressional aides said they were concerned that if\nregulation is reduced, ATT will use its dominant market\nposition to raise consumer rates.\n    Consumer groups say ATT's concern for its business clients,\nits most lucrative market, underscores a danger that, without\nfull regulation from the FCC, any increased costs will be\npassed onto the consumer rather than big business.\n    ATT, however, says deregulation would benefit consumers.\n    The company would become more competitive because it would\nnot have to wait for FCC authorization before introducing new\nservices, spokeswoman Edith Herman said.\n    However, Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation of\nAmerica, which represents more than 200 consumer groups\nnationally, said, \"When ATT offers new services, they tend to be\ngeared toward the high volume business market rather than the\naverage consumer.\"\n    ATT proposed that in addition to lifting profit regulation,\nthe FCC allow new rates to go into effect in 14 days instead of\nthe current 45 days.\n    The company also called for a reduction in the amount of\ndocumentation it must file with the FCC each time it introduces\nor changes long-distance services.\n    \"With this filing, we're suggesting that regulators replace\na blanket approach to regulating ATT with a more finely-tuned,\ntargeted approach,\" said Lawrence Garfinkel, AT&amp;T's vice\npresident of marketing services, in a statement.\n    \"We believe that by using a scalpel instead of a meat axe,\nthe public interest can be protected and all consumers will\nbenefit,\" he added.\n    MCI Communications Corp, also asked the FCC to ease\nrestrictions on ATT, saying this would encourage competition.\n    Some industry analysts said the MCI proposal was an effort\nto halt FCC-mandated price cuts that have forced ATT and its\nrivals to cut prices, eroding profits in the industry. MCI lost\n448.4 mln dlrs on sales of 3.59 billion dlrs last year.\n    The analysts said the proposal would benefit MCI because\nATT would no longer impose price cuts that MCI would have to\nfollow when costs fell in the industry.\n    \"I'm sort of mystified by those comments,\" retorted Herman, a\ndistrict manager for ATT.\n    \"ATT (if deregulated) has no intention of not passing on\ncost reductions,\" she added.\n    Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation,\nsaid he opposed deregulation because it left no alternatives\nthat would ensure against overcharging by ATT.\n    He said the FCC had in the past instructed ATT to reduce\nprices when the company was benefitting from lower costs from\nincreased use by consumers of long-distance services.\n    Without full regulatory authority this may no longer\nhappen, he added.\n Reuter\n",

But liquidity was tight in early business because\nbanks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale of\nTreasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for\nthree-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.\n    Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday,\nflowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return\nuntil tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.\n    Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name,\ncommanded short-term money requirements of as much as five\nbillion marks or so.\n    With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the\nmonth, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills,\ndraining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought\nfunds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess\nfunds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.\n    One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced\nknowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its\nsales of treasury bills on Friday.\n    Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total\nminimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank\nhas an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate\nthe strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.\n    \"(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not\nselling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this\namount,\" he said. \"If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the\nmarket then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will\nbe different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so.\"\n    But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in\nrates, given the delicate state of currency markets.\n    International central banks have been at pains to prevent a\ndollar fall against major currencies, including the mark.\nDealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer\nundertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar.\n    \"The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between\nthree and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today\ncannot be very popular,\" the senior dealer said.\n    Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average\nrates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or\nfour pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned\nwithout the excessive draining through the treasury bill\nmechanism.\n    Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations\nbetween Germany's major employers and the unions, the\nBundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to\nmonetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said.\n    Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the\nLombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion\nmarks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business.\n REUTER\n",

Such a\nLIFFE contract is expected later this year.\n    LIFFE liquidity could be higher than at the SIMEX, where\naverage daily volume in Treasury bonds dropped to 165 in\nFebruary from 1,286 last October when the bonds were first\nintroduced.\n    The contracts were set up to attract hedging from the\nrapidly growing underlying cash market in U.S. Treasury bonds\nin Toyko, but interest has waned as that market has grown more\nstable, traders said.\n    Restrictions on investments by Japanese residents have also\ninhibited the growth of the futures contracts in both Singapore\nand Sydney, the banking sources said.\n    Nevertheless, all 450 seats on SIMEX are now taken, with\nthe last trading at 55,000 dlrs against the initial price of\n50,000 dlrs. The current bid is 55,500 dlrs, but offers at\n65,000 show that confidence in SIMEX remains, said Michael\nKillian, general manager of Chase Manhattan Futures Corp.\n    Killian, a SIMEX board member, said the CBOT night session\nmight raise arbitrage opportunities and SIMEX would benefit\nfrom a local stock exchange index contract planned for the end\nof 1987. SIMEX also became more competitive after this month's\nbudget eliminated withholding tax on interest earned on futures\nmargin deposits.\n    Banking sources said the tax change would boost SIMEX\ntrading by non-bank institutions and individuals and would\nbenefit foreign firms and institutions.\n    While the Treasury bond contract has been somewhat\ndisappointing, other SIMEX contracts continue to expand, Fong\nYew Meng, SIMEX assistant general manager, told Reuters.\n    Volume in the SIMEX's Nikkei stock index, based on the\nTokyo stock market, has risen to a daily average of more than\n1,000 contracts this month, from 320 contracts last October,\nhelped by uncertainty during the recent bull run in Tokyo\nstocks, Fong said.\n    Open interest in the Nikkei contract, introduced last year,\nreached a record 2,697 on February 26.\n    Killian said the Nikkei contract has considerable potential\nfor expansion, as overseas investors have been avoiding the\ncontract because they currently see no need to hedge the rising\ncash market in Tokyo.\n    SIMEX is also enjoying record trading in other contracts.\nIn February, total volume on the exchange reached a record\n122,819 contracts, surpassing the previous monthly record of\n116,767 set in September. Eurodollar volume reached a record\n78,546 contracts last month against 70,306 in September.\n    SIMEX is likely to try to maintain its growth by moving\ninto options soon, but competition continues regionally as well\nas globally, banking sources said.\n    The Sydney exchange plans to introduce by June a share\nindex futures contract based on a composite of stocks on which\nequity options are traded, which could generate more liquidity\nthan the ordinary index, banking sources said.\n    Local interest in the Sydney Treasury bond contract may\nalso flare if the Sydney exchange establishes a three-way link\nwith Chicago and London, traders in Sydney said.\n    LIFFE is discussing such a link with the CBOT, they said.\n REUTER\n",

Reagan's term expires in January 1989.\n    A majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives\nand 13 in the Senate apparently decided their own political\nconcerns have become more important than the president's.\n    \"President Reagan, he ain't going to be running in 1988, but\nI am,\" Congressman Arthur Ravenel, a South Carolina Republican,\nsaid on Tuesday of his decision to back a bill that means money\nand jobs for his home district in new highway construction.\n    The defeat interrupted a good streak for Reagan, who won\napplause for his selection in February of former Senate\nmajority leader Howard Baker to replace Donald Regan as White\nHouse chief of staff, and was believed by most political\nanalysts to have benefitted from a televised speech and a news\nconference on the Iran affair last month.\n    A steady drop in Reagan's job approval ratings appeared to\nlevel off in recent weeks. The president slumped from about 65\npct last autumn to about 42 pct after the Tower Commission\nreport in February said he had failed to exercise proper\ncontrol over the dealings with Iran.\n    His approval rating hovers at 50 pct.\n    Reagan said he was deeply disappointed by the Senate defeat\nbut \"my efforts to control spending are not diminished.\"\n    Democratic leader Robert Byrd said \"this isn't going to make\nor break the president.\"\n REUTER\n",

Jobs were his top priority, he said.\n    For his crucial first budget, Haughey has ruled out any\nincrease in the level of government borrowing and forecast\n\"widespread cutbacks with severe restrictions right across the\nboard.\"\n    Finance Minister Ray MacSharry also stressed that some of\nthe 187,000 civil service jobs must go to trim Ireland's annual\npublic wages bill of 2.84 billion punts.\n    \"The big question now is to what extent he will grasp the\nnettle and cut in next Tuesday's budget,\" said Kevin Barry,\neconomist with National and City Brokers.\n    \"You have to cut the Exchequer Borrowing Recquirement (EBR)\nsubstantially and swiftly. He has to do it now,\" Barry said.\n    Noting that last year's EBR was 2.145 billion punts, he\nsaid \"Two billion would be good news.

Heinz chairman Tony O'Reilly, one of the most\nsuccessful Irishmen in international business, stressed the\nneed for a frontal attack on the national debt, arguing \"many of\nour children have lost faith in the future.\"\n    \"Were there to be an uptick in world interest rates or a\nprecipitous decline in our parities, the effect on our economy\nand on the provision of services by our government would be\ncatastrophic,\" he said.\n    This island of 3.5 mln people has been living beyond its\nmeans with a state spending spree on welfare benefits that\ncould not be financed by economic growth.\n REUTER\n",

But critics have\nbeen warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs\nis helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.\n    Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases\nthat develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect\nhumans.\n    But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England\nJournal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.\n    The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number\nof people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant\ninfection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to\n298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the\nvictims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized\nfor their illness.\n    They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always\nprevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating\nraw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, \"the\nmajority of cases appear to have been caused by eating\nhamburger that was at least partially cooked.\"\n    The researchers said the results show that \"food animals are\na major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections\nin humans, and that these infections are associated with\n(antibiotic) use on farms.\"\n Reuter\n",

He said the\nchanges sought by the U.S. would require loan approval by a\ngreater majority of shares than a simple majority.\n    But he stopped short of reaffirming the original U.S.\nposition that veto power should exist with a 35 pct vote.\n    Enlarging on reforms Washington would like to see, Baker\nsaid he wanted the IADB to play a much greater role in the U.S.\ndebt strategy for promoting inflation free economic growth,\nopen markets and a reduced government role in the economies of\ndebtor nations.\n    Under reforms he said the U.S. wants the IADB to adopt a\nmajor program of lending to specific economic sectors in debtor\ncountries on condition the countries carried out policy reforms\nin those areas of their economies.\n    Such reforms would include, among other things, more\nconcern for natural resource management.\n    Baker said this lending should help debtors make a\ntransition to more open economies and freer markets.\n    He also said the bank could double its current lending\nvolume from capital and triple its concessional loans to the\npoorest nations.\n    The Treasury Secretary also called for the IADB to improve\nits analysis of the policies of debtor countries, strengthening\nits process for assessing the specific needs of debtor nations.\nHe urged a wholesale reorganization of bank personnel. Baker\nsaid, \"We simply believe that more discretion and policy\ninfluence should lie with the parties which contribute the\nlion's share of resources.\"\n    He pointed out that despite tight budget problems the\nReagan administration has asked Congress to finance the IADB\nand other multilateral development banks.\n    Pointing out that such funding was difficult today in the\nbest of circumstances, he said it would be impossible if\nCongress did not have confidence in bank lending policies.\n Reuter\n",
