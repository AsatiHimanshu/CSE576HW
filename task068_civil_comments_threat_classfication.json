And this is for everything from small studio accessory dwelling units to 4bd/3ba houses.  There is a significant demand for shorter term leases, even among people whose finances are rock solid, so it's not a living-paycheck-to-paycheck phenomenon.\n\nIf a landlord is the one refusing to offer a longer term lease because they want to jack up the rent every other month, I think that is different, but as I said elsewhere in this thread, any good landlord is going to want a longer-term lease and will screen carefully to get a nice, low-hassle tenant, because that is win-win.",

It's notable because it's a cheap, small caliber round that is useful if you want to plink cans, bottles, coyotes, rabbits, etc.  Used against a person, it could injure or kill, but not as badly as all the other caliber rounds, less the .17 cal.  There's nothing particularly powerful about the weapons he used. My 700 ADL uses a  .30-06 round and is much more powerful, and expensive to buy. A .30-06 incidentally is about the average size rifle round one would use for deer or elk. Your statement alone shows just what kind of an ignoramus and a tool you really are. He used a small caliber repeating rifle, the kind you would likely take with you to shoot squirrels or rabbits. That's all it is. What makes it massively powerful in your eyes?",
