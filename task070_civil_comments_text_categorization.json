No \"interpretation\" on the part of any court was needed.\nIn my opinion, constitutional interpretation is a slippery slope. After all, anyone, including a judge, can interpret any constitutional clause any way he or she wants even if totally detached from logic and reality. (Perhaps we've seen this?)\nRather, Judge Scalia's tenets of texturalism and originalism are what's needed; close adherence to the original meaning and intent of the Constitution. If it's clauses are no longer relevant and do not serve our nation, the proper and more difficult course is to amend the Constitution rather than take the less difficult path of interpretation.",

For more than seventy years, the State Board was involved in the US eugenics movement, using theories partly constructed from genetics to control the reproductive health of citizens.  During the 1970s, many male and female teenagers at homes for wayward teens, (Fairview Hospital and Training Center)   were injected with sedatives and sterilized against their will. -Nancy Rae Cook v. State of Oregon (1972), 17-year-old Nancy Rae Cook appealed the Board of Social Protection's ruling that she be sterilized due to mental illness resulting from childhood physical and sexual abuse - See more at: http://embryo.asu.edu/pages/oregon-state-board-eugenics#sthash.955F7Qmg.dpuf",
