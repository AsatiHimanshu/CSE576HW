The Republican Party may not be an overtly racist organization, but the recent rise in popularity of Donald Trump, in part due to his racist comments, reveals the pervasive racism within the Party which was previously obscured.  The highest ranking member of the Republican Party, Paul Ryan, recently condemned Trump's attack on a Hispanic judge as \"textbook racism.\"  Yet Ryan continues to support Trump.  Maybe, as you say, it's because Ryan wants Trump to be elected because he would replace Scalia with another conservative.  If so, it shows that eliminating racism is not high on the Republican agenda.  Republicans have been fanning the embers of racism by questioning Obama's American citizenship and by opposing nearly all legislation that Obama has proposed.  The embers have now burst into flame.",

Rather than permanently putting an end to the Permanent  Fund dividend as we know it, the Legislature should keep the current structure and ANNUALLY - not just once as proposed by McGuire- determine how much of the earnings reserve is needed for the general fund and how much can be distributed to Alaskans.\n\nP.s.

HB156 allows sex-ed to be taught in public schools by a certificated teacher or by a person who is supervised by a certificated teacher. It also allows parents, most importantly, to review the curriculum no later than 2 weeks before the class begins. Parents, who are ultimately responsible for their child's education, can also opt their child out of the sex-ed. What is wrong with that? NOTHING!",

It will take both approaches to obtain results.\nThe Malheur occupation was a situation of rich ranchers exploiting the ignorance of poorer white people to legitimate the privatization of public lands, one of the aims of the super rich. The Malheur occupation didn't succeed. Poor white people have the disadvantage of being sucked into believing their interests lie with rich whites when it doesn't.

I will never forget riding in the cage on the back of the truck with my hand over the bleeding dog's throat.  He died.  I was covered in blood.  We did locate the pit and the owner's kids had let the dog out.  We took the dog.  I'm not sure but I think we euthanized the dog at the owner's request.  It was a really friendly pit.  Also, two pits got into my yard and killed some of my pet rabbits.  They had traveled about 3 miles to my house.  They were really friendly.  I put them in the empty rabbit hutches.
