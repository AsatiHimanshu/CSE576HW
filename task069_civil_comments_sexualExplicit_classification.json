Guns play an outsized role in spontaneous suicides.  Someone in a momentary crisis situation with a tendency toward depression and perhaps under the influence of alcohol or drugs grabs a gun and it's over.  A noose requires work,  other means lead to prolonged periods between initiating the attempt and death, which gives time for an intervention or for the suicidal person to seek help.\n\n2/3 of our gun deaths are suicides.

If the potential shooter knows that pulling the trigger costs a great deal (in terms of sentence), we win through lives saved. Drugs should be legalized.

While it may feel good to lock folks up for long terms, we pay for the good feeling.
