Their chairman, Belgian Paul de Keersmaeker, told a pressconference this morning ministers gave a majority vote infavour of all aspects of an EC Commission compromise proposalintroduced on Tuesday.    However, the minority against the crucial plan for a tax onvegetable and marine oils and fats was big enough to block itsadoption, and British Agriculture Minister John MacGregor saidother aspects of the proposals are likely to be vetoed.    MacGregor said the meeting foundered in part because of animplicit indication from the West Germans that they wereprepared to veto two other aspects of the package, the futuremonetary compensatory amounts system and proposals directlyconnected with common prices.    De Keersmaeker said he will now consider when ministersshould be called for further talks, but diplomats said theoutcome of the meeting makes it almost certain the majoroutstanding issues will be referred to EC heads of governmentwho hold a summit meeting on June 29 and 30 in Brussels.    A Commission official said the Commission will work outstopgap measures which it will bring in on July 1 if thedeadlock persists. These will concern products such as cereals,colza, sugar, beef and milk, for which there would otherwise beno legal EC regulations from that date.    Trade sources expect these will include a seven pct cut inguaranteed prices for most cereals.    The official said the measures \"will take into account thesituation in the market, but also the EC's severe budgetarysituation.\"    The Commission was expecting an EC budget deficit this yearof almost six billion dlrs even before it presented itscompromise, which would have cost almost one billion more. Itestimates the oils and fats tax would bring in 2.3 billion dlrsin a full year.    Diplomats said Britain, West Germany and the Netherlandsmaintained their opposition to the tax despite Commissionattempts to persuade them it would not unfairly hit exportsfrom countries outside the EC.    They added Denmark did not formally state its finalposition but was understood to remain against. REUTER",

SAS signed a letter of intent for the MD-11s last December,but a company statement said the decision on whether to hardenthis up into a firm order would be linked to the outcome ofnegotiations with the United States on deregulating air faresacross the North Atlantic.    The SAS move, said by analysts to be a big blow toMcDonnell Douglas, came following a Copenhagen board meeting ofthe airline in which the governments of Sweden, Denmark andNorway jointly own a 50 pct stake. The remainder is held byindustry.    A company statement said SAS would wait to see the outcomeof the government-to-government negotiations with the UnitedStates, in which the three Scandinavian countries have demandedgreater access to the U.S. Domestic market for SAS in exchangefor deregulating prices across the North Atlantic.    At present SAS is allowed to fly to New York, Chicago, LosAngeles, Seattle and Anchorage.    SAS gave no details of the Airbus Industrie counter-offerfor its long-range A340, but said it will study the bidfurther.    Swissair yesterday confirmed an order for the MD-11 longhaul jets worth 1.2 billion Swiss francs and said it hadpreferred the McDonnell Douglas planes over the A340, a projectthat has not yet been formally launched, as it met theairline's requirements better and would be able to enterservice in 1990.    SAS President Jan Carlzon announced the MD-11 order lastDecember, saying the plane would replace the airline's currentfleet of DC10s. The first of the MD-11s was to be delivered in1991 for use mainly on its intercontinental routes.    In January, SAS officials said Airbus had made a revisedoffer that included larger, more powerful engines and twoversions of the four-engine plane. One would seat 220passengers and another 260 against the MD-11's 265-seatcapacity.    The offer was part of a drive to secure at least fiveairline customers for the new aircraft to enable AirbusIndustrie to launch production. Airbus is expected to decidewhether to go ahead with the project next month.    SAS officials earlier said they did not expect the firstA340 to be delivered before 1992. McDonnell Douglas had givenSAS until March 31 to agree to final terms for the MD-11 deal. REUTER",

The dollar fell to 144.30 yen and recovered only slightlyafter foreign exchange traders in New York said the FederalReserve intervened to buy dollars for yen.    But despite the dollar's woes, Japan Development Bank,wholly owned by the Japanese government, raised 150 mln dlrs ina seven-year eurobond carrying an eight pct coupon.    Lead manager for the issue, Bank of Tokyo, said the deal,at the time of pricing, was to yield 60 basis points overcomparable maturity Treasuries. However, by the close oftrading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slidein aftermarket activity.    Dealers noted that the spread to Treasuries is wide for anewly-priced AAA-rated borrower like Japan Development Bank.For example, earlier this week, the World Bank raised U.S. Dlrsat only 25 basis points over Treasuries. Dealers said thatbecause the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- thelast time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.    But officials at Bank of Tokyo said the spread is intendedto compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertaintycurrently associated with owning dollar securities.    The officials said the borrower opted to raise funds indollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is theonly market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size.Japan Development Bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.    Market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped intoyen as the borrowers previous issues were.    Late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its feesat less 1.75 less 1.55.    Also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering fromToshiba International Finance (Netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8pct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.    Three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered,the largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by SekisuiChemical Co and guaranteed by Sanwa Bank Ltd. The issue hasequity warrants attached and late in the day it was quoted onbrokers' screens at 106-1/2, bid only.    The Australian dollar market continued active, withCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offering a bond of 125 mlnfive-year with a zero coupon priced at 54.    Late in the day, the deal was quoted at less 1-1/4 bid. Asimilar deal yesterday by Toronto Dominion, priced slightlyhigher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, wasquoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.    Dealers said that investors are apparently willing toaccept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points lessthan annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retailbuyers. Also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest ratesfall in Australia as many analysts expect, the potential forcapital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. The bonds are alsobetter for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.    Dealers said that the Australia dlr zero coupon bonds areapparently being placed with retail accounts on the Europeancontinent with very little placement being done in Japan.    Euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices ondomestic Japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade asthe yen soared. After the markets closed, the dollar fell to144 yen.    The European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a 40 mln euroyenissue paying 4-5/8 pct over seven years. This is the secondseven-year yen issue in two days -- a sector of the yield curvein Japan that dealers feel has not yet become overpriced. REUTER",

The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage housesis likely to pay off in dollars and international marketposition, they said. \"It's part of a trend towards growingcapital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreignfinancial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst withKleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.    The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm describedby some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will giveNippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions onWall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of itsassets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.    Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in businesssectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory assetmanagement, market research, and consulting on financing.    Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and theworld's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve thedeal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese lifeinsurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.

Hutton and Co'sboard and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become alimited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller andproblem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going forblue-chip organisations,\" he said.    \"It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturingindustries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With ahistorically high yen, and historically low interest rates,there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\"    Competition in fund management has grown along with greaterJapanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mlnyen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17to 18 pct, he said.

Tax receipts, at 25.11 billion, were well above the 1985figure of 22.19 billion and the forecast for 1986 of 23.71billion. This left a surplus on cash transactions totalling1.94 billion francs against a forecast 102 mln and the 1985deficit of 696 mln.    Income and wealth taxes ended 749 mln francs aboveforecast, 378 mln of which came from higher than expectedreceipts on the stamp duty on financial market transactions.    Taxes on comsumption brought in 638 mln francs more thanplanned and other taxes 16 mln francs more, the ministry said.    The ministry said the improvement in the overall accountreflected years of efforts by the government and parliament tointroduce saving and the acceptance by people of necessary taxincreases. But economic factors, including the low rate ofinflation, the weak dollar, falling interest rates and low oilprices were also important factors.    A spokesman for the ministry said the government had usedits improved cash position to retire about one billion francsof government debt, which accounted for the difference betweenthe 1.94 billion surplus on cash transactions and the 905 mlnfranc overall surplus.

Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending willcontribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.    As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.    \"Growth in consumer spending in the United States will dropdramatically this year because the jump in inflation will causea falloff in the growth of disposable income,\" Van Dyke said.    Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.    The report was released before the Commerce Departmentreported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personalconsumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared witha 0.6 pct increase the month before.    The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boostconsumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.    This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.    As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing powerof an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrsthis year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.    The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housingstarts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.    \"For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,\" Van Dyke said.    Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on animprovement in trade. \"However, with protectionist attitudes onthe rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,\" headded.

Escalante told a news conference here he \"carried the weightof the negotiations\" at the meeting by calling for larger exportquotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations.

The company, built around Murdoch's two billion dlracquisition of seven television stations last year, marks thefirst network startup since 1948, when ABC, now owned byCapital Cities/ABC Inc CCB, hit the airwaves.    \"I think our goal, more than anything else, is to providean alternative to the three networks,\" said Fox president JamieKellner.    Fox's debut comes when earnings at two of the threenetworks are under pressure and network advertising dollarshave been growing slowly.    \"The barriers to entry are exceptionally high,\" industryanalyst Peter Appert of C.J. Lawrence said. \"Their (Fox) savinggrace is that their parent has deep pockets.\"    The question television industry, advertising and WallStreet executives are asking is whether this new entry can lureadvertisers from the big three: CBS Inc CBS, ABC, and NBC, aunit of General Electric Co GE.    Network advertising revenues rose to 8.6 billion dlrs in1986 from 8.3 billion a year earlier, with NBC accounting forall of the gain. Revenues at CBS and ABC declined, analystsnoted.    \"They (Fox) are competing for the same pool of funds as thetraditional networks,\" said Jon Mandel, associate mediadirector at Grey Advertising Inc.    But James Mandelbaum, a Los Angeles-based entertainmentattorney said, \"If they have enough money, they have a goodchance of making it work.\"    Fox president Jamie Kellner said the company expects tolose 30 to 50 mln dlrs this year on revenues of about 150 mlndlrs. He said it will take three to five years to turn aprofit.    To succeed, the company must also win over the youngviewership it has targeted with an offbeat set of shows, two ofwhich debut this Sunday, and another, next weekend.    The first Fox-produced program -- \"The Late Show,\"featuring comedienne Joan Rivers -- was shown last fall onFox's seven stations and close to 100 affiliates. Although theshow has dropped recently in ratings, it still has a captiveyoung audience in the late night time slot, analysts said.    Sunday's prime-time shows include a situation comedy,\"Married ... with Children,\" which Kellner describes as analternative to the suger coated family shows on the networks.It is also airing \"The Tracy Ullman Show,\" featuring theBritish comedienne, singer and actress.    Fox has lined up 107 independent TV stations around theU.S. to run the shows. The networks have some 637 affiatedstations.    To make sure viewers get a chance to see the programs, thecompany is taking the unprecedented step of airing them threetimes in the course of the evening.    \"I believe if some of their shows were on the traditionalnetworks, it would be extremely high-rated,\" Mandel said, whoadded that his firm has signed up several million dlrs inadvertising for the shows.    But some question whether Fox will really become a fourthnetwork. Robert Adler, president of the CabletelevisionAdvertising Bureau, said many cable shows are geared to theaudience Fox is attempting to win. \"There are already manyalternatives out there to the three networks,\" he said.    And at least one network is not yet ready to consider Foxthe competition. An ABC spokesman said, \"the schedule we've puttogether for this Sunday night ... has not taken Fox'sprogramming schedule into account.\"    But analysts noted that the major networks are keeping aeye on the venture to see how it fares in the ratings and withits advertisers.    Fox also appears willing to take a long-term view. Askedwhether the company will be looking at ratings after Sunday'sdebut, Kellner said, \"the last thing I want to do is worryabout ratings because that was the last thing Murdoch told meto do.\" Reuter",

Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in theUnited States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, ornon-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spotsupplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,analysts said.    Texas Eastern pipelines TET, the other competingpipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the Southclosed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union hasrelied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.     In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrsper mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gascosts four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.    Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide openaccess to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fearof accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.    Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers forgas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.    Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount ofsupplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, aBrooklyn Union official said.    Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidmost of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed throughto rate payers.    While net effect on the company will not be known forseveral months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,will end up paying more for gas, he said.    Because the closure takes place in summer months when gasdemand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would besmall, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson LufkinJenrette, said.    If the situation persists into winter heating season, highcost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.    Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco forspot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co NCNG,Piedmont Natural Gas Co PNY, will face the same high costfactor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager withend users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokeringfirm, said.    \"But these companies are not unwitting victims of thetake-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,\" he said.    Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's requestfor an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facilityfor spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.    Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas willthreaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting toalternative fuels, he said.    In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is beingnegotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.    Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gasfor them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatoryon the inventory charge, he said.    \"Cool heads will prevail,\" DLJ's Launer said, \" but it maytake a while.\"        Reuter",

Goodeand Co told Reuters.    CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gasinterests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would insteadsell it to Exxon Corp XON unit Esso Exploration andProduction Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs.    In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largestsugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct itdoes not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd.    \"This will be a big shock to the market, which was under theimpression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,\"McKibbin said.    A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had givenitself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark onan ambitious expansion programme in its best-performingdivisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.    CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the rightto share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from anoil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years.    Delhi is one of Australia's largest onshore oil producersyielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin.Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrsfor every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs.    Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker Bain and Co Ltdsaid the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industrywas a sensible one but added that it represented the loss ofAustralian-owned assets to a foreign company.    \"The farm they bought back a few years ago is being soldback to the Americans,\" Goldston-Morris said.    The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far thelargest player in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industryand would give it access to some of the best sugar propertiesand mills in the country, analysts said.    They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommendacceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from thebottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.    Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne nextseason from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said.    Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaginginvestment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company'soverall performance, analysts said.    CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses onwhat had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirelyfrom U.S. Dollar debt, they said.    \"It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirelywith debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oilprice collapsed on them,\" Owen Evans of Sydney broker Mearesand Philips Ltd said.    Esso not only picked up Delhi's oil and gas output but alsogained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax lossesaccumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions.    Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stakein Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co LtdBRKN.S.    \"Esso has been very keen to diversify from the GippslandBasin. They haven't found too much oil in Bass Strait latelyand Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,\"Goldston-Morris said. REUTER",

Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about ninepct.    Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive andcost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the truepotential of the former CP Air, which floundered for fourdecades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian PacificLtd.    They said CP Air's management style had been not muchdifferent from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, becauseneither airline was held accountable to its owners.    \"Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, thesetwo airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neitherseemed that concerned about the bottom line,\" said Bradley.    \"But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be veryconscious of profitability and shareholder return. And AirCanada is on the verge of going that way,\" he said.    CP Air, always fighting for market share rather thanprofits, was \"a perennial money-loser,\" analyst Wilfred Hahn ofBache Securities Inc said in a recent report.    Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulatedlong-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, itslosses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs.    Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later thisyear in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs onrevenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of morethan 2 billion dlrs.    Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold tothe public, the prospect of privatization at a time ofincreased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay moreattention to finances, analysts said.    It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit \"inexcess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs\" for 1986. However, this profitrecovery was due less to management skill than the fact thatall Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.    Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 inVancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.    For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct airtraffic growth, and they expect profits will come fromcost-cutting and careful spending.    Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd saidinstitutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to theirportfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that newcompetition makes profit growth less certain.    \"The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. Atone time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobodyelse's,\" Friend said.    Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airlineshares for at least a year.    Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of apublic stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routeswithout setting off a political storm.    It also will be faced with an expensive but necessaryupdating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.    Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase ofa dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie.    Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week orderedsix commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it wouldsoon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or theBoeing Co.    Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these withouthurting profits.    Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects CanadianAirlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western. Reuter",

Moving reluctantly into line with most private sectorforecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflationestimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut itseconomic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget lastseptember.    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figureswould not push the government off its chosen mix of pricederegulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.    But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they wouldpush to protect the purchasing power of their members, raisingthe spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.    And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believedPrime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growthand rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidentialelections due by April 1988.    \"The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,\"said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. \"We have theimpression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growththis year.\"    \"The big question is whether the government's policy of wagemoderation will be maintained,\" he added.    The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for risesjustified by increased productivity.    But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, EdmondMaire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands alreadyrejected by the government for indexation clauses to be builtinto future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higherprices.    Calling the government's policies \"unbalanced and unjust,\" healso demanded investment incentives to boost employment. Heannounced after his meeting that Chirac had told him thegovernment would spend two billion francs on a series ofmeasures to boost employment and training    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderateForce Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chiracearlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest ofFrance's unions, declared the defence of its members earningsits top priority.    But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, andstill rising, government supporters and some economic analystssaid they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.    \"Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialistgovernment and I dont think this administration is going toreverse that,\" commented Michel Develle, economist atrecently-privatised Banque Paribas.    Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmasand the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higherinflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, hesaid.    Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even morethan the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.    \"But that would still be an exceptional achievementconsidering that for the first time since the Second World Warall french prices have been freed,\" he commented.    Finance Ministry officials said that the governmentsabolition of price and rent controls last year was responsiblefor nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January livingcosts.    But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that shouldhave no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.    Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so longas the government kept wages under control.    Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally morethan forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,he added.    Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be tohelp the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budgetdeficit, several analysts said.    So long as public sector wages are held down, higher ValueAdded Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset aloss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower thanexpected growth, they said.

During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets inLibya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S.Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take acircuitous route. That angered Washington.    The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said ayear ago Washington felt the French were not taking strongenough action against terrorism. \"Now they are. We're pleasedand they are pleased that we are pleased,\" one said.    More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grainmarkets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the EuropeanCommunity  threatened to become a trade war.    In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberateCommunity moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States waspoised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community foodimports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.    Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad,supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored amajor success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last basesin northern Chad.

At the top of the list is theCommunity's common agricultural policy (CAP).    To Washington, as one official put it, \"CAP is the root ofall evil\" in international food trade because it subsidisesfarmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below worldprices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets.

In high-level talks last week, the U.S. Criticised Japan'soverall fiscal policy as deflationary and argued that itsfiscal position is not as dire as it says.    The criticism reflects a growing feeling among some U.S.Policy-makers that Japan's tight fiscal policy is frustratingattempts to stimulate domestic demand and boost imports.    The U.S. Attack represents a distinct shift by theconservative Reagan administration, which until recently hasbeen sympathetic to Tokyo's efforts to reduce the governmentrole in the economy, diplomats said.    Pointing out that Japan pledged in Paris last month to takeaction to boost demand, a senior U.S. Treasury official saidthe April package must be more than routine.    Japanese government bureaucrats have already said they donot expect the package to contain much more than a rehash oflast April's measures.    That means accelerated public investment, lower interestrates on government housing loans and measures to pass alongthe benefits of the strong yen to consumers, none of whichwould have a major immediate economic impact.    Several Japanese officials agreed that the real obstacle tostimulating the economy is the fiscal policy pursued by theFinance Ministry and said they welcomed the shift in U.S.Policy.    But they expressed concern that the move might backfire byfanning resentment against U.S. Interference in domesticaffairs.    Makoto Kuroda, vice minister for international affairs atthe Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said Japanwould stimulate the economy not in response to U.S. Criticism,but to meet mounting pressure from Japanese businessmen.    The shift in U.S. Policy is also causing some nervousnesswithin the Reagan administration.    U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs AllenWallis told reporters last week the U.S. Does not necessarilywant an increase in Japan's budget deficit.    \"There are many measures Japan could take to stimulate itseconomy,\" he said.    The argument is not new and has been raised in the past bythe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.    What is new is U.S. Backing for the position.    At last week's talks, Japanese officials said, they arguedTokyo had been able to maintain a tight fiscal stance and boostthe economy with funds from the giant postal savings system.    But the Finance Ministry was interested enough to ask for,and receive, the figures supporting the new U.S. Position, asenior U.S. Official said.    Other western officials are not so sure. They said it wouldtake time to boost public investment much further, as there arenot that many projects in the pipeline.

Other food samples sent for testing at Cologne University,including honey, fruit, vegetables, pork, milk and butter, werefound to be free of radiation, it said.    Data in the letter showed the tea and hazelnuts containedcaesium levels far in excess of ceilings recommended by theUnited Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).    The letter said people who had consumed the tea faced noparticular health danger as most of the caesium remained in thetea leaves, but it warned against eating the hazelnuts.    The products sent for testing were bought in state shopsand private farmers' markets in Moscow, it added. Other Westernembassies in Moscow said they had discontinued laboratorytesting of Soviet food late last year because no abnormalradiation levels were detected.    \"We didn't find anything so we stopped doing it,\" a U.S.Embassy spokesman said.    A British spokesman said radiation-monitoring equipmentremained in the embassy waiting room for British residents inMoscow who wanted to check their food, but laboratory tests hadnot been conducted for several months.    \"Earlier we sent some food back to Britain as aprecautionary measure, but we stopped in the absence of anyalarming signals,\" he said. \"If the tests had shown abnormalreadings, they would have been resumed.\" Reuter",

We are exceedingly profitable,\" aspokesman for the firm told Reuters.    The rumors that have swirled around Drexel, more than anyother broker, have involved concerns that its business will bethreatened by the Federal probe, say Wall Street sources. Thefirm has long been at the leading edge of the mergers businessand had ties to now-disgraced speculator Ivan Boesky.    In the latest chapter of the story, Drexel said that somecommodities firms have begun to limit the amount of businessthey will do with the firm, citing credit risks. Drexel haslong been a powerful competitor in precious metals markets.    But Drexel spokesman Steve Anredder told Reuters thatDrexel's overall business is proceeding normally and thefirst-quarter profit \"could be the strongest of anybody on WallStreet.\"    \"I wouldn't say we're not feeling any effect (from thetrading probes),\" he said. \"But we're doing extremely well.\"    The firm was among the first to be subpoenaed in thegovernment's wide-ranging probe of illegal trading involvingthe use of confidential company information on Wall Street.    Believed to be under particular scrutiny was Drexel's \"junkbond\" operation -- the issuance of high-risk speculative debtthat it pioneered for financing corporate takeovers.    \"We have done nothing wrong,\" said the Drexel spokesman.\"After a thorough investigation, we have found no evidence ofany wrongdoing by the firm or anyone within the firm.\"    The spokesman said that in the aftermath of the Boeskyarrest, Drexel had not been charged. Nor had any individual atthe firm been charged with illegal acts while employed byDrexel. One of its top merger specialists, Martin Siegel, wascharged in connection with a former job.    Still, more than any other firm on Wall Street, Drexel hassuffered the consequences of the insider trading probe. Tobegin with, there have been a series of brief shocks in thejunk bond market, in nervousness linked to rumors that Drexelmight be in trouble.    At one point, Drexel said Wednesday, a large Midwest bankrefused to allow Drexel-issued bonds as collateral on creditlines. Two weeks ago, the restriction was withdrawn, it said.    The company also was notified last month that the outsideinsurer of Drexel's individual brokerage accounts had decidednot to renew coverage. Drexel has set up its own subsidiaryhandling part of the insurance. American International Groupand a group of British underwriters have handled the rest.    Drexel also appears to have lost ground to others in themergers and acquisition business recently, market sources said.However, Anredder said that there was no sign that Drexel hadlost any customers at all owing to the insider trading cases.But in citing results for the quarter, the company pointsmostly to other areas of success.    Corporate financings have totaled 8 billion dlrs, including3 billion dlrs in new junk bonds in the January-March period,Drexel said. Drexel maintains the lion's share of thislucrative business, trade sources noted.    The market for junk bonds, although jittery, \"has ralliedback with a vengeance,\" Anredder said.    Although they see new competition in the junk bond arena,market sources concur that Drexel remains king of the hill.    While some of the leading Wall Street firms were limitinghead-to-head dealings with Drexel in the commodity markets based on worries over the credit of the company, the Drexelspokesman called this \"ridiculous.\" Reuter",

Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unitacquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlawpresident Michael de Groote told analysts.    Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs,or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.    De Groote also said the company expects \"excellent results\"in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be morespecific.    He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does notinclude possible further acquisitions and said that theaddition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988through fiscal 1990.    De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous fourquarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. Therest came from acquisitions, he said.    Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation,a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this willnot make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said.    He also said he is \"not very optimistic\" about the ongoingnegotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-basedchemical and solid waste services company with Canadian andU.S. operations, from Trimac Ltd of Calgary.    De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of theproposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within thenext 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemicalwaste business through GSX Corp.    \"We feel it is a profitable business with good growthpotential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the rightmanagement,\" de Groote said.    Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S.subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.

Currently, while there is an implied obligation on the partof firms to make markets in issues they underwrite, there is noformal obligation to do so.    Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, inexplaining why the recommendation was adopted, said \"It is aimedat the problem of the lead manager who does a deal anddisappears.\"    Sibson said the organization cannot force its members toadhere to the rule. \"We're under no illusions about the legalbinding force of these recommendations,\" he said.    Lead managers have occasionally abandoned efforts tosupport an unprofitable issue just a short while after it hasbeen offered, leaving investors and smaller firms with no oneto buy it back from them.    Most recently, when prices of perpetual floating ratesnotes (FRNs) suddenly plunged, most market makers abandoned thesecurities altogether, leaving investors stuck with about 17billion dlrs worth of unmarketable securities on their books.     Sibson noted that the recommendation adopted by the boardonly applies  to fixed-rate dollar issues and would not havehelped the floating rate sector out of its current crisis.    Among other measures, the IPMA also decided that thecriteria for membership should be tightened to exclude some ofthe smaller firms.    Under the new rules, a firm must be the book running leadmanager during the two preceding years of 12 internationallydistributed debt issues denominated in U.S. Dlrs or in one ofeight other major currencies.    The former requirement called for three lead-managedissues. Sibson said he expects the tighter entrancerequirements to pare 3he current list of 67 members down by sixto 10 members.    Smaller firms have criticized IPMA's efforts to restrictmembership to the larger firms, saying it is anti-competitiveand that it reinforces the big firms' already large marketshare.    \"Belonging to IPMA carries a certain amount of prestige withborrowers,\" said a dealer at a small foreign bank. \"The borrowersays to himself, \"Well I can travel economy or I can travelfirst class,'\" he said.

Critics of costly federal farm programs maintain that thegovernment could get out of guaranteeing minimum support pricesif farmers systematically used options contracts to protectthemselves against vacillating market prices.    \"With agricultural options now available, there is less needfor government price support programs to provide pricestability for farmers,\" the Heritage Foundation, a conservativethink tank, said in a recent position paper.    \"Washington no longer needs to restrict the level andvariability of commodity market prices. Farmers and others inagribusiness can now achieve the benefits of price stability bytrading in option markets,\" the paper, written by ClemsonUniversity professor Kandice Kahl, said.    Critics of farm programs contend that options offer thebenefits of price support programs without entailing the costto taxpayers.    Kahl's paper urged farmers to buy \"put\" options in order toobtain the right to sell at a particular price to the privateseller of the option contract.    \"This gives the farmer a guaranteed price, but still allowshim to profit from higher market prices, if they are available,by foregoing his option,\" Kahl said.    Interest in promoting understanding of options tradingamong farmers also has been stirred in Congress by a proposedchange in agricultural policy that would have the effect ofexposing participants in federal farm programs to fluctuationsin income subsidies.    The proposal -- supported by the Reagan administration anda cross-section of lawmakers -- would allow farmers to receiveat least 92 pct of their income subsidies regardless of howmuch they planted.    Under current law, farmers enrolled in federal pricestabilization programs receive income subsidies, or deficiencypayments, equal to the difference between a set target priceand the higher of the support price or market price.    The so-called decoupling plan, or \"0/92\", would aim tocurtail surplus production by eliminating the requirement thatfarmers plant in order to receive deficiency payments.    Critics of \"0/92\" plan contend that if the scheme succeededin curbing surplus output, market prices would rise anddeficiency payments fall -- leaving farmers who chose not toplant with shrunken income subsidies and no crops to sell.    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), who has been in theforefront of efforts to decouple income support from acreageplantings, advocates replacing the variable deficiency paymentwith a fixed and gradually declining payment.    But many farm state lawmakers are turned off by the idea ofoffering fixed subsidies to farmers who plant nothing.    Some congressional staff members said they are intrigued bythe notion of having the federal government subsidize thepurchase of \"call\" options to help farmers hedge their incomerisk.    By buying a call option, the farmer would obtain the rightto buy a commodity at a particular price. If the market pricerose above that option price, the farmer could exercise theoption and sell the commodity on the spot market, making upmost of the reduction in the deficiency payment.    An aide to Boschwitz said the senator might offerlegislation linking options and decoupling, but that it mighthave to await the results of a pilot project on futures andoptions trading mandated by the 1985 farm bill.    The bill required USDA, in association with the CommodityFutures Trading Commission, to conduct a pilot program in atleast 40 counties which produce major program crops.    The program, only recently launched, was designed toencourage producers to participate in futures and optionsmarkets and to ensure that producers' net returns would notfall below the county loan level for the crops in question.

The bank's policy-making board on Saturday postponed adecision on the reforms until June in view of strong LatinAmerican opposition to U.S. Proposals to strengthen its controlover lending to the region.    Washington wants to involve the IADB in its debt strategythrough increased lending, but as the bank's largest singleshareholder it also wants to require countries to adoptfar-reaching economic reforms to qualify for loans.    The U.S. Push for IADB reforms, which began at last year'smeeting in Costa Rica, is particularly sensitive in aninstitution Latin Americans have traditionally thought of astheir own.    \"It's almost an issue of sovereignty for the LatinAmericans,\" one IADB official said.    With a 54.2 per cent voting bloc, Latin American nationshave had relatively easy access to 35 billion dlrs in projectloans since the bank's founding in 1959.    The bank has also been run for the past 12 years by aMexican, Antonio Ortiz Mena, who has been increasingly criticalof U.S. Debt strategy in the last two years.    Ortiz Mena says commercial banks must renew lending to theregion if debtors are to grow and repay creditors. At a newsconference last week he warned that Latin defaults were adistinct possibility in the long run.    Brazil insists its debt service obligations should in noway interfere with growth priorities, a position putting theissue of debt relief squarely into focus for the first time,officials and delegates said.    They said creditors are not ready to discuss debtforgiveness and prefer to look at schemes such as debt-equityswaps in combination with a continuing emphasis on economicreforms.    Washington wants the IADB to impose greater conditions onlending, and has threatened to block increased appropriationsfor the bank if it does not get its way.    Latin America, while retaining reservations, now acceptsthe principle of setting greater conditions on loans, but isunwilling to countenance U.S. Demands for greater veto powerson lending, officials and delegates said.    Washington has pushed for veto power to be lowered to 35pct from a simple majority as at present. Latin Americans areunwilling to go below 40 pct, which would oblige the U.S. Toline up two other voters or voting blocs on its side.    This attempt to weaken Latin America's voting power, andparticularly a threat by Washington to reduce funds to the IADBunless its reforms are accepted, has created considerableresentment among Latin Americans.    \"Debtors have already shown considerable willingness tosacrifice over the last five years so economic adjustment isnot at issue,\" one Latin American official said.    The region has been hoping for a seventh replenishment ofIADB resources of at least 20 billion dlrs for 1987-90, asagainst 15.7 billion for the previous four-year period. REUTER",

            "input": "The easing of rules governing overseas useof the yen has caused an explosion of Euroyen bond activity buthas failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency,bond managers and traders said.    Although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues inthe Eurobond market, few foreigners are interested in keepingthe yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but theJapanese, they said. This lack of real yen demand through thefreer Euroyen market is undermining the 1984 U.S. And Japaneseaccord to internationalise the yen, they said.    The borrowers want to take advantage of low Japaneseinterest rates but have no need for yen. They arrange primarilywith Japanese banks to exchange yen funds into othercurrencies, mainly dollars, bond managers said. More than 85pct of Euroyen bond issues are swap driven, they added.    \"The borrowers don't care which currency they use. They areonly after attractive money,\" one bond trader said.    Issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previousyear, boosting Euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of thetotal Eurobond market, Koichi Kimura, managing director ofDaiwa Securities Co Ltd, said recently.    Traders said some of the activity stems from battles amongJapanese and foreign securities companies and banks for theprestige of placing a larger share of issues. Many even resortto \"harakiri\" swaps, those with unprofitable pricing.    But the fever continues and the number of offerings coulddouble again in 1987, said Naoki Yokoyama, manager of NikkoSecurities Co Ltd's international capital markets operation.    The Euroyen bonds, once issued, are mostly picked up byJapanese trust banks, one trader said. After a 90 day waitingperiod the bonds flow back to Japan where investor appetite isstrong, he added.    Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when moreattractive yields are offered on dollar and other currencyinvestments, traders said.    \"Even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing(in yen),\" said Masaki Shimazu, manager of Daiwa's bonddepartment.    While few foreigners are interested in the secondarymarket, Japanese commercial banks, regional banks, lifeinsurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy thebonds and await their flow back to Japan since they offerlittle currency risk, traders said.    The Finance Ministry last April shortened the waitingperiod before issues could flow back to Japan to 90 days from180. A ministry official said it verified through sampling thatreflow was fairly small.    \"We believe the Euroyen bond should remain mainly in theEuroyen market,\" he said.    One trader said that although demand from Japaneseinvestors is heavy, it may prove to be only short-term. He saidmany investors plan to sell their bonds if Japanese or U.S.Interest rates decline further.    To encourage further international use of the yen, theministry is considering allowing the issue of Euroyencommercial paper, the official said, adding that it is studyingdemand from potential borrowers.    Securities company sources believe the ministry will permitnon-residents to issue Euroyen commercial paper within the nextfew months. But they expect it to continue to ban domesticparticipation in the market for some time to come. Japanesebanks object to the short-term paper market which they seeencroaching on their business territory.    Traders said Euroyen commercial paper could spur moredemand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shiftinto shorter-term securities if need be.    \"Commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps,\" one bondmanager said. If more financial instruments were available,there might be more trades in yen, he added.    Euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity, thoughsome recent issues which are callable in three years work as ifthey had shorter maturities, traders said.    The ministry is expected to allow four-year Euroyen bondmaturities within a few months.    One yen bond manager said Japanese financial authoritiesare giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rulesgoverning international transactions of the yen. But freer useof the yen could encourage more trade settlements in theJapanese currency, he said. \"If exporters or importers can raisefunds in yen, they will be more willing to agree to using theJapanese yen as a settlement currency,\" he added.    The Finance Ministry official said the government mustconstantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit ofborrowers and investors. \"No major market can keep its statuswithout change,\" he said.

The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year intothe oil and gas industry and could lead to more than onebillion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.    The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada onor after April 1, 1987.    Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aidpackage is aimed at small and medium sized companies.    The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration andDevelopment Incentive Program, will restrict the total paymentsthat any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.    Masse said the program will probably generate newemployment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.    He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration anddevelopment spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oilprices fell during the first half of 1986.    Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decidedto provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax payingcompanies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the fullvalue of the incentive. Such companies would not immediatelybenefit from tax benefits, he said.    The federal government also wanted to deliver an aidprogram outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilsonis now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce taxreform proposals later this spring.    An important feature of the aid program is a decision tolet companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors tobenefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits toonly participating companies, he said.    Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make iteasier for companies to attract investors in exploration anddevelopment, Masse said.    He told reporters his department is still consideringwhether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify forthe subsidy. Reuter",

The company said itsrevenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and achange in accounting practice. It added that revenues wouldhave risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainlydue to its life insurance business.    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rosedespite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums andhigher personal risks.    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damageinsurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health andlife insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a changein accounting for U.S. Annuities.    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personalinvestment influences that it should be accounted differentlyfrom the more traditional insurances.    This change in accounting practice and another change toaccount for profits made on fixed interest investments,resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mlnguilders.

The ruling was an important victory for the oil companiesand the Reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasingprogram and a setback for two small Alaskan villages thatchallenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment.    The administration said that the court-ordered halt indrilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paidfor 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980.    A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to haltall exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts inthe Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to thesubsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos.    But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong inissuing an injunction halting exploration.    \"Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration wasnot at all probable,\" Justice Byron White wrote for the court.\"And on the other side of the balance of harms was the factthat the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrsto exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 whichthey would have lost without chance of recovery had explorationbeen enjoined,\" he said.    The oil companies, Amoco Corp AN, ARCO, Exxon Corp XON,Mobil Corp MOB, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc TX and Union Oil,had said that voiding previously granted leases would result instaggering financial losses.    The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres andgenerated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs.    Administration officials, saying the lease sales werepreceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied thatthe oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources.    The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with anorganization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued thatthe drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing. Reuter",

But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, saidthe expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did notnecessarily threaten stability.    The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in whichthree -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise inGNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.    The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome inview of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience hasshown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a pricerise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.    Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears mayseem exaggerated, they said.    \"But it has often turned out in the past that the priceclimate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank intoa restrictive policy,\" they said.    The economic costs of a preventive stability policy areless than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.    The four institutes disputed the view that monetaryexpansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domesticinvestors switch liquidity into longer term capital marketinvestments following lower interest rates.    \"Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion ofcentral bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to asmaller expansion of money supply,\" they said.    A return to growth and stability did not requirespectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly withopen market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoidan interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.    The DIW institute said monetary policy should not befocused simply on growth of production potential. Because ofuncertainty about exchange rate developments and economicweakness other factors should be taken into account.    Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cutsand avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluationspeculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threatin itself to price stability.

Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on theuse of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 couldresult in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs.    However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in netsavings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs, he said.    Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly theentire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have beenforfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC.    In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have beenredeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges wouldhave remained in the goverment inventory, he said.    When asked to comment on a recent study by the GeneralAccounting Office that concluded certificates result in a netcost to the government, Amstutz said, \"GAO underestimated thebenefits and overstated the costs\" of the certificate program.    Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loanentries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions ratherthan forfeitures.    GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said.    \"There is no question in the mind of the Department ofAgriculture that these certificates have been very useful,\"Amstutz said.    Immediate benefits of certificates include greater marketliquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farmincome, and improved debt situation and decreased carryingcosts, he said.    Certificates are an integral part of USDA's long-rangemarket-oriented farm policy, he said.    Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep.

With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector,falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the reportpainted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.    But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be aprimary factor behind the drop in orders for business capitalinvestment.    \"It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said DavidWyss of Data Resources Inc. \"I'm particularly impressed by the19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because itmay be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely totax reform than we thought.\"    The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pctdecline in new orders for machinery was led by declines inoffice and computing equipment orders.    Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been aresponse to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and theend of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.    \"It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, sopeople just aren't doing it as much,\" Wyss said.     Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforcedthe view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws,economists said.    November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December'sincreased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported0.9 pct.    But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was causedby more than tax reform.    \"The wash-out that took place in January was far greaterthan the actual gains that took place in November andDecember,\" said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"Theeconomy has a weakening bent to it early in the year.\"    \"The report definitely points to very sluggish capitalspending over the next couple of quarters,\" said Donald Maudeof Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.    Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs asevidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. InNovember, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December theyfell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.    \"It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, whichmay quickly translate to a drop in production,\" MidlandMontagu's Maude said.    Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made ofJanuary's report, given that other reports have reflectedstrength.    But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline inDecember.    He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in Januaryshipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.    \"Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed totighten,\" Data Resources' Wyss said.    \"But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numberslike this. The Fed will wait and see,\" he added.    Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. \"Peoplearen't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed willhave to ease to ensure global growth.\" Reuter",

Association chairman Nyoman Muna said in an interview thatmost banks made windfall profits from the 31 pct devaluationagainst the U.S. Dollar.    He saw the outlook for 1987 as more favourable forIndonesia, with oil prices now around 18 dlrs a barrel.    But he forecast that overall bank profits would probablyfall slightly from 1986 pre-tax levels, which he said wereartificially high due to the devaluation.    The Association's latest report on the performance ofIndonesia's 112 state, foreign and private banks shows thatoverall profits rose in 1986 to 495 billion rupiah from 385billion in 1985.    This was after a fall in first half profits to 202.9billion rupiah, from 238.1 billion in January-June 1985.    The report shows foreign bank profits slumped in 1986,mostly due to a loss by Bank of America NT and SA.    Bank of America, a branch of BankAmerica Corp BAC.N, wasaffected by a string of bad debts and other problems during theyear. It showed a loss of 32.03 billion rupiah, against a lossof 3.48 billion in 1985, and 1984 profit of 7.25 billion.    A bank spokesman told Reuters he believed Bank of Americain Jakarta was now back on track. \"The worst is behind us.\"    Its assets have fallen to 194.07 billion rupiah in 1986from 293 billion in 1985 and 301.5 billion at the end of 1984.    Indonesian profits of the 11 foreign banks allowed tooperate in Jakarta fell to 6.58 billion rupiah from 39.2billion in 1985, the report said.    These profits do not include offshore loans, which arehandled through other centres but which account for most of theforeign banks' business.    Profits of Indonesia's seven key state banks, which accountfor more than 80 pct of domestic banking assets, rose sharplyto 319.09 billion rupiah in 1986 from 212.0 billion.    Total assets of the seven rose to 40,232 billion from31,288 billion rupiah, the report said.    Profits of BNI 1946, the largest of the seven, rose to63.28 billion rupiah from 35.9 billion in 1985.    Its total assets expanded to 12,115 billion from 8,552billion at the end of December 1985.    Muna said in the fiscal year starting April 1, budgetedgovernment spending will fall in real terms. Many ministrieshave had budgets cut severely due to declining oil revenues.    \"This will naturally have its impact on the banking sector,\"Muna stated. \"But I think that with oil around 18 dlrs, thegeneral performance of the banking sector will not be too bad.\"    Western bankers said the capital market remained sluggish,but Indonesia was using more foreign loans.    Bank of Tokyo BTOK.T, the only Japanese bank allowed tooperate here, almost doubled its assets in 1986 to 607 billionrupiah from 335 billion in 1985, the report showed. But itsprofit was barely higher at 8.5 billion from 8.4 billion.    Citicorp's CCI.N local unit Citibank, previously listedas the largest foreign bank, slipped to second place behindBank of Tokyo. It recorded a loss of 480 mln rupiah against a1985 profit of 11.9 billion.    A Citibank spokesman told Reuters the loss was abook-keeping issue and did not represent the true picture, butdeclined to give further figures.    One western banker said that \"Citibank is still definitelythe largest foreign operation in Jakarta, whether or not itsprofit figures show it.\"    Bank of Tokyo and Citibank ranked 10th and 11th in terms ofassets of all banks in Indonesia.

In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leavingunchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against arecord 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.    The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat andcoarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mlnagainst 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mlnrise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.    The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 islikely to be down from last year as low world prices andrestrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.    At least four of the five major exporters expect to see adrop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. Thereis still potential for even higher average wheat yields but theIWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.    Although it is still early to assess the coarse grainoutlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in theEuropean Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area isexpected lower but oat sowings could rise.    After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Unionplans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mlnhectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields arelikely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improvedweather and a further increase in the use of intensivecultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Sovietmaize output in 1987, the IWC said.    Any reduction in world coarse grain output would bebolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWCsaid.    It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks atend&#127;of different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mlntonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.

            "input": "West Germany's capital marketliberalization program has stalled and bankers are worried itmay take years for further reforms to be completed.    Liberalization got underway in May 1985 when foreign banksreceived Bundesbank permission to lead-manage mark eurobonds.    Further moves included introduction of mark-denominatedcertificates of deposit last year. But other changes, includingrevisions in the domestic options market and introduction offutures contracts, need lengthy statutory changes and this maytake years, bankers and dealers say.    Deutsche Bank AG co-chairman F. Wilhelm Christians calledlast week for an enlargement of current capital marketinstruments to include instruments already standard abroad.    He said these are needed especially when prices fall,citing declines in West German share prices in the first twomonths of this year when stock indices fell about 20 pct.    Others are more blunt. Securities dealers say the lack ofviable hedging instruments for shares and bonds makes tradingin domestic markets too risky.    \"We need a stock index futures contract, and a futurescontract for recent government bonds,\" one dealer said.    West Germany now has options contracts on about five pct ofshares and bonds traded on exchanges here, covering only about30 pct of the average traded volume, stock market sources said.    Options can only be written on the original 14 bondsselected when bond options were introduced last April. The mostrecent bond on the list was issued in 1985.    There are no futures exchanges in West Germany. Germanbanks may participate in futures exchanges through branchesabroad but these are at least outwardly subject to stringentWest German rules requiring that every contract be secured on aone-by-one basis with a separate hedge, to prevent speculation.    Another problem is a lack of liquidity in the existingmarkets, owing to lack of private investor participation.    Private individuals and corporations do not engage inoptions trading now due to West Germany's civil and exchangelaws, which define losses made in futures and options businessas gambling losses, which investors need not pay back.    Options business has been hurt by lack of liquidity frompension funds, which currently are forbidden to invest in theseinstruments. But they are to be allowed to enter the businesssoon as the European Community begins to harmonize rulesgoverning funds.    Manfred Laux, general secretary of the West German mutualfunds association in Frankfurt, said harmonized rules are to beadopted by October 1, 1989 at the latest.    The push to adopt new instruments has not been great in thepast, owing to wide-spread belief they are speculative, whichgives them a bad name in West Germany. But pressure for theirintroduction here is growing.    The start-up of a Swiss futures exchange has some bankersconsidering if a similar exchange would be useful in WestGermany. They say that without innovations, some business coulddrift to London, which the Bundesbank vehemently opposes.    An official at the London International Financial FuturesExchange (LIFFE) said the exchange currently has no plans tointroduce more mark-denominated contracts beyond the existingmark-dollar contract. But he said the exchange is studying thefeasibility of other contracts, including one for three-monthmark interest rates and possibly a government bond contract.    A Bundesbank capital markets expert said the Bundesbank hasno objections to hedging through futures but any liberalizationin that sector is still in the early planning stages afterearlier talks ended two years ago.    Considerations about the futures business have been drawnout because of the large number of participants involved intalks. They include parliament, the Bundesbank, the FederalBanking Supervisory Board, eight West German stock exchangesand their governing states, and the four West German bankingassociations.    Beyond options and futures, other changes being suggestedinclude replacing the federal government's current bondconsortium with an auction procedure similar to one beingconsidered in the U.K. And already in practice in the U.S.    This would upset the existing market order providing Germanand foreign banks in the consortium with fixed quotas but itwould eliminate the misallocations some bankers say presentlyarise within the fixed consortium quota system.    In addition, some bankers would like the method of bondtrading on the West German stock exchange changed to a systemof continuous price-setting from the current system in whichevery bond price is fixed once a day.    This would make trading more transparent if it reduced theproportion of off-floor interbank bond trading, now some 90 pctof the volume of bond transactions here, the bankers say. REUTER",

Speaking to the House subcommittee responsible for farmcredit issues, Farm Credit Administration (FCA) board memberJim Billington said \"My recommendation is that legislation(aiding the system) must be moved prior to June, 30, 1987, orit will be difficult to close the (farm credit system) books.\"    Billington's loss prediction is gloomier than either thesystem or its regulator had previously admitted.    The system itself has so far predicted losses for all of1987 will reach only 1.1 billion dlrs, down from 1.9 billion in1986 and 2.7 billion in 1985.    However, Billington said the system is losing in excess of400 mln dlrs per quarter, implying total losses for 1987 ofmore than 1.6 billion.    Losses of that magnitude would exhaust the 1.4 billion dlrsin capital surplus the system held at the end of 1986.    The system also has 4.2 billion dlrs in capital held by itsmember borrowers, called borrower stock, which theoreticallycould be used as capital.    Billington said by the end of 1987, more than 1.6 billiondlrs of the 4.2 billion in borrower stock would be downgradedin value because of the mounting losses.    Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, urged thatCongress begin to consider legislation rescuing the system byEaster and that a bill be completed by the fall.    Chairman of the House subcommittee, Rep. Ed Jones,(D-Tenn.) said today \"the time has arrived to considerassistance to save the system.\"    The Senate Democratic leadership indicated last month thatit would begin drafting a bailout bill by Easter.    FCA board members differed on whether a direct governmentinfusion of cash will be needed to rescue the system. FCAchairman Naylor said a federal guarantee of both borrower stockand system bonds held by investors might avoid the need toprovide \"hard capital\" to the system.    However, Billington said \"its not really that simple, in myopinion,\" adding that government funds may be needed to rescuethe system.    Neither regulator estimated how much money might be needed.

He said in a statement, \"The idea with the foreign banks isto obtain from them the best terms to give the Ecuadoreaneconomy a complete relief in the period of deferral of paymentson the foreign debt during the present year.\"    The statement referred only to payments due to privateforeign banks, a senior government finance official toldReuters.    These creditors hold two-thirds of Ecuador's foreign debtwhich totals 8.16 billion dlrs.    It did not refer to debts maturing to foreign governmentsand multilateral lending agencies, accounting for the remainderof Ecuador's foreign debt, the official said.    He said Ecuador owed the private foreign banks between 450and 500 mln dlrs in interest payments for the rest of 1987 andabout 66 mln in principal payments maturing this year.    Cordovez said Ecuador would seek new loans frommultilateral organisations. A World Bank mission was due heresoon to evaluate emergency loans, government officials said.    Ecuador has also appealed for emergencyaid from about 40 foreign governments.    Government officials have calculated losses to the 1987budget from last Thursday's earthquake at 926 mln dlrs.    In 1986, Ecuador's total service on the foreign debt wasabout 996 mln dlrs to all creditors.    The quake ruptured Ecuador's main oil pipeline, suspendingcrude exports for five months until the line is repaired. Oilaccounts for up to two-thirds of its total exports and up to 60pct of total revenues. Before the tremor, Ecuador suspendedinterest payments on January 31 to private foreign banks.    Officials said they stopped interest payments due to acash-flow squeeze stemming from a slide in world oil prices,which cut 1986 exports by about 25 pct to 2.18 billion dlrs.    Ecuadorean finance officials have been in telephone contactevery day this week with some of the banks who sit on its14-bank advisory committee, the senior government financeofficial said. The committee represents the country's 400 or soprivate foreign bank creditors.    Cordovez also said in the statement, \"The banks shouldperceive that it is impossible at this moment to comply withwhat was forseen.\"    Cordovez added, Ecuador must make a new proposal in linewith the reality since the earthquake by seeking better optionsof deferment and of softening the negotiation conditions.\"    Interest payments fall due at least monthly to privateforeign banks.    Ecuador's initial proposal earlier this year was to makeonly one semi-annual or one annual interest payment this year.    Under this proposal, it sought to defer interest paymentsuntil June at the earliest, foreign bankers and governmentofficials here said.    Ecuadorean officials held their last formal meeting withthe advisory committee in New York in January, but thenegotiations were suspended on January 16 due to the 12-hourkidnapping of President Leon Febres Cordero by air forceparatroopers.

Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issuestoday by the Bank of England.    The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.    The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risksassociated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchangecontracts and similar financial instruments.    Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelinesfor calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activitiesthat banks would be required to take into account incalculating the minimum financial cushion they would need tomaintain.    Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loansand other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk thatwould establish a bank's minimum capital needs.    The additional guidelines proposed today would determinethe amount of capital support required for a bank's currentexposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.    The current exposure would be measured by themark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect thereplacement cost.    Potential future increases in the replacement cost would becalculated using credit conversion factors based on statisticalanalyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. bankingregulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of theasset.    The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balanceconflicting needs for precision and simplicity.    They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of theparticular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.    Board officials said the new gauge could increase thecapital required of the largest money center banks, which arethe principal participants in these types of activities.    They cautioned the Fed board to take account of thepotential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks tocompete in world financial markets.    However, the staff concluded, \"The credit risks inherent insuch contracts now constitute a significant element of the riskprofiles of some banking organizations.\"    The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largestparticipants in this market, on grounds the benefits ofincluding the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.    Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchangecontracts traded on organized exchanges.

He told a news conference he had planned to sit down with aconsultative group of major donors led by the World Bank latethis month in Tokyo but said the documentation of the projectwould not be ready until the end of this month.    \"The World Bank has recommended that we meet some time inthe second half of May because it is pointless to have thatmeeting unless the participants have had adequate time toreview the documentation,\" he said.    Government officials said the progam, estimated to cost 36billion pesos, aims to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land,including some 50,000 hectares seized from former associates ofdeposed President Ferdinand Marcos.    The new plan will include not only rice and corn land butalso sugar and coconut plantations. It is expected to benefitabout three mln impoverished peasants.    Ongpin said earlier there was strong interest in theprogram from donors but said given the substantial financialrequirements of the plan, the government could not rely on onlyone source but on a combination of sources.    President Corazon Aquino approved last month the use of anestimated 20 billion pesos from the proceeds of the sale ofcertain non-performing assets to private companies.    Ongpin said he has asked Aquino to consider two othersources, namely the proceeds from the sale of governmentcorporations which are to be privatised and proceeds from theliquidation of seized Marcos-related assets.    He also said he would recommend public hearings before sucha big project was legislated.    \"If we get a good reception in the public hearings, perhapsthen the President might feel persuaded that it is notnecessary to wait for the Congress,\" he said.    Aquino had said she would prefer that legislation for theprogram be approved by a two-house Congress, whose members willbe elected on May 11.

He told a press briefing Wednesday that Manila has droppeda two-tier interest payment offer, which would have given banksa higher return if they took partial payment in new Philippineinvestment notes (PINs) instead of in cash.    \"The PINs proposal has been laid aside.... The discussion isnow on pricing (of just the cash payments),\" he said.    Foreign banking sources in Manila said on Tuesday that thePhilippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 7/8over the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) but Ongpin wouldnot discuss details of the pricing negotiations.    He also refused to speculate on when an overall agreementmight be reached. The talks have been going on for more thanthree weeks.    Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8over LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs -- tradeable,dollar-denominated, zero coupon notes that could potentiallyyield up to one point over LIBOR.    The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee atleast a 7/8 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still hadgrave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for otherlarge debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.    The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as aseparate option for those banks, which might want to fund theirown investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in thesecondary market, Ongpin said.    Under Manila's plan, the PINs would be redeemable at fullface value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investmentsat any time prior to their six-year maturity date.    While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINsproposal, Ongpin said there was great interest on the part ofcertain investment banks which are already active in thesecondary market for sovereign debt.    Unlike current debt/equity schemes, Ongpin said, the PINswould include no government fees and would be free from\"administrative hassles.\"    He said about six investment banks had been approached andfour had replied so far. One even showed interest in buying 45mln dlrs worth of notes, he said.    Ongpin said that by funding current interest payments inthe secondary market through the PINs scheme, the Philippinescould conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreignexchange reserves during its planned seven-year restructuringperiod.

The British colony last week issued a banking licence tothe Bank of Fukuoka Ltd, making it the 24th Japanese bank here.    Japan has the largest banking contingent in Hong Kong,followed by the U.S. With 22 banks. Eleven Japanese banks haverepresentative offices here and Japanese institutions operate34 deposit-taking companies (DTCs).    Assistant banking commissioner K.K Wong told Reuters: \"Thereare no special favours towards the Japanese...But because ofJapan's strong economy and currency, they easily meet ourrequirement on assets (14 billion U.S. Dlrs).\"    The Japanese control the largest share of assets of thefinancial institutions here but incorporated elsewhere, with980.5 billion H.K. Dlrs at end-1986, or 57.5 pct of the total.    \"Hong Kong authorities welcome Japanese banks,\" said HaruoKimura, assistant general manager of the Bank of Tokyo. \"But theU.S. And Britain are unhappy with the slow liberalisation ofthe Tokyo financial market.\"    Japanese bankers said Hong Kong offers good businessopportunities, especially in China trade, to Japanese banks whoare following their clients' international expansion.    \"As their clients become more international, they have tokeep up and follow them,\" said Yutaka Toda, Dai-Ichi KangyoBank's general manager here.    \"We can have access to local traders and regionalcorporations,\" said Bank of Tokyo's Kimura. \"We can also pick upbusiness with China.\"    Bankers said more Japanese banks are on the way. An influxof Japanese banks began in the late 1970s when the governmentlifted a moratorium on new licences. But newcomers are allowedone branch each and only the Bank of Tokyo, Sanwa Bank andSumitomo Bank have more than one branch.    Because of this limitation, Japanese banks have mostlyconcentrated on wholesale business.    \"It is very difficult to compete with those giants such asthe Hongkong Bank and the Bank of China,\" said Kimura of theBank of Tokyo.    Bank of Tokyo has the largest Japanese bank network herewith seven branches, while Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corpand the Bank of China groups each have hundreds of branches.    To broaden their client and deposit base, some Japanesebanks have taken equity in local banks. The latest such movewas Dai-Ichi Kangyo's increase of its stake in Chekiang FirstBank last year to 95 pct from 33 pct.    Tokai Bank, Fuji Bank and Mitsubishi Bank also haveinterests in small local banks.    But Mitsubishi, not content with its single-branch licenceand a 25 pct stake in the small Liu Chong Hing Bank, boughtMercantile Bank Ltd's multi-branch licence early this year.    \"We will open one more branch in (Hong Kong's district of)Kowloon soon, to better serve our clients on the other side ofthe harbour,\" said Mitsubishi Bank general manager TakeshiTange.    Their weakness in the retail market forces Japanese banksto rely on the interbank market for funding.    Government data show that despite their large share oftotal assets, Japanese banks had only 54.4 billion dlrs indeposits at end-1986, or 17.1 pct of deposits of banks in HongKong incorporated elsewhere.    \"Most Japanese banks' international lendings in the regionare booked in Hong Kong,\" said a Japanese banker who declined tobe named.    He said it is mainly for tax reasons, adding that assetssuch as loans booked in Hong Kong are not subject to Japanesetax.    Japanese banks are barred by the Tokyo government fromissuing Eurobonds, but their Hong Kong subsidiaries can tap theEuromarket and lend the funds to the parent.    Bankers said this role could be undermined by a five pctcapital adequacy ratio that goes into effect next year,requiring many DTC's to increase their capital. Many Japanesebanks are seeking special treatment for their largely offshoreoperations or a different risk calculation for their assets.    \"I don't think this will stop them from coming here,\" said abanker. \"But it may mean they have to conduct some of theiroffshore funding operations elsewhere.\" REUTER",

The measure comes one week after the central bank raisedreserve requirements on domestic deposits by one percentagepoint to 19 pct, also with effect on Friday.    Banking sources say the high real interest rates on offernow -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- have attracted alarge influx of speculative foreign capital which isthreatening the government's monetary targets.

The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobondsecurities issued each year. In 1986, about 183 billion dlrs ofnew eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled byEuromoney magazine.    Up until now, there have been no restrictions on leadmanaging eurobond issues.    However, eurobond market participants believe the Bank ofEngland is concerned about intense competition for market sharewhich may have caused some firms to expose themselves toimprudent credit risk.    Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers asbanks compete to offer the best terms. But the new rulessuggest that some constraints may be placed on competition asregulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more riskthan it can handle. Banking sources said that while the Bank ofEngland is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing toaccept some constraints in order to ensure that underwritersact prudently.    \"The Bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank'slead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skilland experience of the lead underwriter in the particular marketconcerned...,\" the Bank's proposal said.    Once a firm has received permission to act as leadunderwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of theface amount of the securities. Nominal exposure exceeding 60pct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and itmust be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct ofcapital.    The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. Afterthat, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will beassessed at their full face value.    The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities,revolving credits or commercial paper, the Bank said.    The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthenits supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which calledfor comments from professionals by March 31 to allow theirpossible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its plannedfinal discussion in Parliament, scheduled before summer.    The new Banking Bill, updating the 1979 Banking Act, is thethird leg of the Conservative government's legislation for thesupervision of financial institutions.    It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act,aimed to bolster investor protection, and the BuildingSocieties Act, which put these institutions on an equal footingwith banks.    The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions betweenrecognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legalcontrols, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors.    Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England inadvance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of theircapital, and to have the Bank supervise exposures between 10and 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed.    However, preliminary consultations with bankrepresentatives had shown some of the initial proposals to beflawed, it said.    Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on acase-by-case basis rather than along general lines.    Amendments involved the Bank's proposed treatment ofexposures by financial institutions acting as banker to otherunits of their own group of companies, the paper showed.    They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure tolocal governments and other public sector entities, and ofexposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks.    Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor ascollateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed.    Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within theirown group of companies would usually be looked into on acase-by-case basis under new proposals, it said.    The paper said exposures to state-owned industries andother public sector authorities in the U.K. and abroad shouldbe given the more lenient treatment of credits to governmentsprovided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees.    It cautioned that exposures to U.K. local authorities andthose guaranteed by the British Export Credit GuaranteeDepartment would probably not qualify for such treatment.    On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary ofanother bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceilingcould be exceeded in individual cases.    But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertakingto take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and statein writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary'sbalance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said.    On collateral security, it said this \"should normally onlybe taken into account when considering the acceptability of abank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base.\"    \"The presence of security taken on its own will beconsidered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposurein excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptionalcircumstances and even then to a very limited extent,\" it said.

But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the ParisGroup of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterlingbroadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sourcessaid.    Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closingtrade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after theParis meeting and up 0.4 on the day.    Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.    A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanteda substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question istherefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.    Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch EuropeLtd, estimated that the government wanted to see thetrade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. \"Even after this actionover the last few weeks, sterling's only just within strikingdistance of that range,\" he said.    Other analysts agree that the government probably has somebroad target range around this area.    However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see thepound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk ofa loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.    \"If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as theyare, what's to stop it (going higher),\" said John Cox, executivedirector of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the Londonforeign exchange market.    Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been activeselling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack ofgeneral market talk of such intervention, and this has helpedkeep it below 1.60 dlrs.    The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.    But Cox says the government must be worried with sterlingheading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if itholds around these levels.    He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interestrate boat. \"If rates don't come down, the market will say theyought to have come down and will sell sterling,\" he said.    Most dealers agree there is a good deal of \"hot money\" beinginvested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnightor one-week rates, which could flow out at equally shortnotice.    However, the authorities will hope that at least aproportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.    \"The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) andhave to jack them back up again,\" said Richard Jeffrey,economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.    He said a half point cut would ensure continued support forsterling, at least in the near term.    However, most analysts are still looking for a full pointabout March 17, Budget Day.    The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to theBudget, said Temperton.    The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in therun-up to a general election, the major factor behind currentbullishness in the government bond and currency markets.    \"Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest ratecut,\" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, theequities arm of Mercury International Group.    Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead theway lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall inthe weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct lastFriday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.    This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 113/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowestsince base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.    However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-monthsmoney, banking sources said the market could not take the cutas a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates. REUTER",

Czarnikow says in itslatest sugar review.    The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a verynominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to theintervention price, with detrimental consequences forproducers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as anattempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrenderedsugar.    The Commission may also take other steps to dissuadeproducers from their chosen course, such as removing the timelimit on storage contracts, which presently means thatintervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September,Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of productionquotas being reduced.    If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders forexport, the restitutions would have to be higher than those atrecent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the differencebetween the EC price and the world market price, the extracosts might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says.    The producers might have to repay these costs throughproduction levies and the proposed special elimination levy,Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costscould be recovered under EC rules.    The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes ofsugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with theEC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed tobridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price,Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form ofprotest designed to force the Commission's hand.    In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered forintervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensurethat the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price,West German producers face a further price reduction in Julywith a probable revaluation of the \"green\" mark.    Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem isnot expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared totraders for some years that the EC's export policy isinsufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, itsays.    The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand byincreasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says,suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cutdown the amount of \"unnecessary bureaucracy\" surrounding theexport tender system.

Wednesday borrowings were1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.    \"One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but itprobably isn't,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.    Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policymodestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in thetwo-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averagingaround 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.    However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latesttwo-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demandoften pushes up borrrowings.    \"Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but itlooks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisionslate in the statement period and didn't quite make it,\" saidWard McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today thatthe Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs ormore in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.    Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss inits estimates over the week that caused it to add fewerreserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.    The Fed took no market reserve management action lastThursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It addedtemporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs ofcustomer repurchase agreements and then supplied reservesdirectly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.    Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that thetwo-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged onTuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday'sovernight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.    \"It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy atthis time,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.    Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzisaid the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interestrates to help the dollar because that would harm already weakeconomies in the United States and abroad and add to thefinancial stress of developing countries and their lenders.    \"Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the lateststatement period have to explain why it acted before the dollartumbled,\" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.    He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a newstatement period began today on disappointment yesterday'sWashington meetings of international monetary officials failedto produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.    In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing inWednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view thatthe yen needs to rise further to redress the huge tradeimbalance between the United States and Japan.    The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming forsteady policy now that should correspond to a weekly averageFed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about wherethe rate has been since early November.    \"I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighterpolicy to help the dollar, as some suspect,\" said Sullivan ofDean Witter.

But prospects for1987 and beyond would be distinctly cloudier, bank analystssaid.    Results should show the trend which began this decade wasunbroken. The proportion of earnings gleaned from commissionbusiness should be higher, while the role played by the moretraditional credit lending business would show further erosion.    Stock exchange volumes remained high last year, depite onlymodest share index rises in the year. In addition, major banks last year were very active in newbourse flotations and primary and secondary bond marketbusiness, banking analysts said.    Despite last week's quite strong rally, the depressed stockmarket and forecasts that it would probably not attractsustained interest from the global investment community made adownturn in commission business most likely.    Pressure on the interest rate margin and the increasingcompetition posed not only by foreign banks in Germany but byforeign stock exchanges, particularly London, would also bringmore guarded prognoses for the future from board members.    But one banking analyst said, \"There's obviously no reasonto paint too dark a picture. In this decade so far, the bankshave posted practically only record profits, with increases of50 pct and more. This cycle must clearly end sometime.\"    One problem more psychological than real was West Germanbanks' exposure to Latin American debtor nations. Bankofficials have said that a good 70 pct of the exposure has beenwritten off on balance sheets.    Some analysts consider that the conservative accounting ofGerman banks may in some cases have prompted the writedown of80 or even 100 pct of several exposures there.    With almost all Latin American exposure denominated in dlrsand written down two or three years ago, the U.S. Currency'sfall has made further allocations to country risk reserves forthe region virtually unnecessary.    \"German bank earnings have become much more dependent ondevelopments on the stock exchange than on the debt question,\" asecond analyst said.    It is precisely because of bank reporting rules that allowthe build up of \"hidden\" reserves known only to the Bundesbank,that few analysts produced precise earnings forecasts as theydid for corporate non-banks.

In each case,farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacityfor output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.    The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed butwill be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit onthe production they forego.    The sources said the package also contains provisions forpayments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protectingor improving the environment.    It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favouredfarming areas would be extended to crops. At present suchallowances are available only for livestock.    The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research intoalternative farming techniques, the sources added.    At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessensaid the Commission is also working on proposals to enable theEC and member states to provide direct income supports forrelatively poor farmers.    Andriessen did not give full details, but said member stateaid would be subject to \"strict criteria to avoid distortion ofcompetition.\"    EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive adifficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplusproduction.    The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last nightproposals to pay \"early retirement\" pensions to farmers aged 55or over who gave up production. Those who took their landcompletely out of farm production, rather than passing it on totheir heirs, would have received more generous payments.    Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revisedproposals along these lines in an effort to get a schemeagreed. Reuter",

From an investigators' standpoint, the toughest questionconcerned 76-year-old Reagan's knowledge of the contraoperation.    As expected, the president repeatedly stated -- now calmly,now with some fire -- that he knew nothing about thatscheme, said to have been run by White House National Securityaide Oliver North, since fired, with the knowledge ofpresidential adviser John Poindexter, now resigned.    \"No, that is not true at all,\" the president replied sternlywhen asked about a report Poindexter had told him, twice, aboutthe secret channeling of millions of dollars to the contras.    \"When I went on the air right after the news broke (aboutIran arms deal last November), I did not know at that timethere was any money involved.\"    He said he learned of the contra diversion -- which mayhave broken U.S. laws and will be the top priority ofcongressional investigative hearings on this affair -- onlywhen Atty.

Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference theSaudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose suchconditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment ofits commercial debts last month.    The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oilconsumption in Brazil.    But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds anddecide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobraswill lift the order to cancel the shipment.    Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms byMonday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere.    \"Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be muchbetter for us, because with the market prices more or less thesame, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,\" he said.    Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importingBrazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothingfrom Brazil, he said.    Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industryworkers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobrasoil stocks are \"reasonably balanced.\"     Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, withan average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000bpd.

Since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risensharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index.    While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen anddollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention tosterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage ofrelatively high U.K. Interest rates.    But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the firsttentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday.    The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollardown further in a test of the willingness of central banks tointervene. Analysts say if the banks do not interveneeffectively, the Paris accord could collapse.    \"On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6collapses,\" Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said.    He said sterling would lose out as markets turned theirattention to capital movements whereas previously they had beenrestricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies.    However, although most analysts and foreign exchangedealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation oreven retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharpdrop in the U.K. Currency.    Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K.Political and economic outlook, firmer oil prices andrelatively high interest rates, they said.    Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has beenrunning especially high after last week's budget, seen aspopular both with the markets and with British voters.    Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in theWest German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 istrailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K.    Recent opinion polls showing Britain's ruling conservativeparty ahead of opposition parties in popularity have alsosupported the pound.    In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off twohalf-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less thantwo weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in thenext week or so, has already been largely discounted.    U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are stillrelatively high compared to other western countries, andanalysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikelyto affect sterling.    Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar's decline,dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis.    Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchangemarkets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond(gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point.    Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market hasbeen one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling.    Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steadyfor the next few days while the market awaits furtherdevelopments on the dollar and this Thursday's U.K. Currentaccount figures for February.    Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stgafter January's small surplus. REUTER",

BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amountedto 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.    The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn inpetroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflectingsome improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Straitfields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral andsteel earnings.    They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coalprices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has beenaffected by industrial and production problems.    The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP'slowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors,and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around300 mln dlrs.

Among interleukin's principal U. S. makers are Cetus CorpCTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex CorpIMNX, based in Seattle, Wash.    The journal, to be released late today, contains twoarticles reporting high remission rates several cancer types.    The journal also contains a signed editorial concludingthat the new results mark a significant milestone in the searchfor a successful immunotherapy for cancer.    Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturallyproduced by living cells in the laboratory.    The drug is controversial because it was widely praised asa promising cancer treatment in early reports on itseffectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a yearlater for its failure to live up to its promise and due to itsravaging side effects.    One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West ofBiotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularlysignificant because it found far fewer harsh side effects afterit changed the way in which the drug is administered.    In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancerpatients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancersand a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skincancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities' StuartWeisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine.    For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found noremissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had sideeffects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospitalcare, according to the article.    In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. StevenRosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchersadministered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pctremission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate inmelanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum.    In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of fourpatients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshnessof the drug's side effects as originally administered.    \"Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the searchfor successful immunotherapy for cancer,\" said the editorial,signed by John Durant of Philadelphia's Chase Cancer Center.    \"These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surelydid not describe successful practical approaches ready forwidespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients,\" theeditorial said.    \"On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, asuccessful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then wemay be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction inthe immunuotherapy of cancer,\" the editorial concluded.

They may need an emergency meeting to sort outthe problems,\" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge EnergyResearch Associates, CERA.    Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPECfaces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.    \"OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a productionissue and must be addressed in that way,\" said Paul Mlotok, oilanalyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.    He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and itsability to keep production under control have given way to apessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon ifit wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.    But some other analysts were uncertain that even anemergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC productionabove the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.    \"OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot havedeemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,\" said theregional manager for one of the major oil companies who spokeon condition that he not be named. \"The market is now trying toteach them that lesson again,\" he added.    David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPECto meet before June, although not immediately. However, he isnot optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.    \"They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of thewinter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and Aprilwhen demand slackens,\" Mizrahi said.    But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything morethan reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.\"    Analysts said that the next two months will be critical forOPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.    \"OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weekssince buyers will come back into the market then,\" said DillardSpriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.    But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energyand Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oilhas been rising through the first quarter and this may haveprompted excesses in its production.    \"Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpdand is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what weare seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting thisdemand through current production,\" he told Reuters in atelephone interview.

            "input": "Healthy growth in corporate profits and inconsumer spending, the two pillars on which Japan rests itshopes of sustained economic growth, both look rotten at thecore, economists polled by Reuters said.    Profits and domestic consumption are meant to replaceexports as the engine of growth. But close ties betweencorporate performance and wages mean that the alternativeeconomic model promises little but slower growth, they said.    Falling profits may lead to falling incomes, which in turnwill cut sales and further reduce profits.    The Bank of Japan said in its latest outlook that improvedterms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domesticdemand grow steadily.    However, this would happen only if household spendingincreased in line with the value of real financial assets dueto stable prices, and/or if corporate investment recovered asprofits from domestic sales improved compared with those fromexports.    \"No clear sign of such developments has so far beenevidenced,\" the central bank said.    Poor business prospects are the reason why economic growthwill be slow, even though Japan's terms of trade have improvedsharply due to the strong yen. Economist David Pike of Phillipsand Drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pctwhile output prices fell only eight pct, giving a large pricemargin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companiesdid not pass that advantage on to the consumer.    Last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between thefall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop inconsumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms oftrade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors.    The economists, however, believe this layer of fat willprotect companies for only a short while. As more firms seekmore profits at home instead of abroad, already fierce domesticcompetition will increase, fueled by lower-priced imports.Retail prices will fall. Profit margins will suffer.    A December survey by top business organisation Keidanrenconfirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves.    Of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector, almost80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in productionvolume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance,said Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara.    Main counter-measures cited by the firms include cuttingunprofitable operations, reducing work to sub-contractors(which employ significant numbers of workers), holding downwages, and reducing bonuses. The government has said it fearsunemployment could soon double from three pct now.    Unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurtsales. But reduced bonuses, and worries about individualfinancial security could be even more damaging.    Twice a year, bonuses provide wage earners with whatamounts to an enforced lump sum in savings, encouraging them tobuy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza.    To save funds, some big firms have begun a form of tiedbonus, forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods.    Economists also predict Japanese will not save less thanthe average 16 pct of salary they do now. On the contrary, apoor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen theresolve to put money aside for old age and illness, education,and housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary.    The last government survey of public opinion said over 80pct of citizens will continue to economise. Japan has a rapidlyageing population and minimal social security and its workersfear poverty in their old age.    Faced with such a vicious circle, the government'sreflationary strategies are severely limited.    The commitment by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party andFinance Ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in smallsupplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentivewithout reducing revenue. Independent economists have been lessthan excited at the results.    Provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited.    The 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is politicallyimpossible to cut it further, with the basic bank savings rateat only 0.25 pct, Bank of Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said.    Almost 60 pct of Japanese still hold their savings in somekind of deposit, official figures show.    Moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive whilefirms are planning cuts in capital investment.    The central bank is well aware that soaring stock and landprices are the only current results of high liquidity.    Fear of inflation also limits policy options. Politicalanalysts ascribe Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1986 bigelection victory largely to a long period of almost zero priceinflation. And he found this year that attempts to impose asales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition. REUTER",

It will also free airlines to fly more seats on any givenroute -- something that is highly regulated now -- and to basefares on market forces.

Dlrs, stock analysts said.    Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earningsof between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reportsresults tomorrow for its first year as a public company.    Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd SWPC.HK, madeits earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation inMay last year.    Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, makinga total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in theprospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said.    They said the airline's performance improved in the secondhalf of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mlndlrs.    The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to oneU.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company'sfavour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the timeof the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said.    James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airlineindustry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices wouldaffect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profitsof 1.25 billion dlrs.     Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price andcurrency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative.    \"This is reflected in their interim results which showedthat profit margin has increased,\" said Frederick Tsang ofMansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.    Cathay's six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlierlevels, but profits rose 69 pct.    The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact onthe company's fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel pricesusually lag behind crude price movements by several months,analysts said.    By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against theHong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct andsterling 12 pct.    \"Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar againstCathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yieldsin the first half up 7.2 pct,\" said James Capel. \"This shouldcontinue through the second half to enable passenger yields toend the year up 7.6 pct.\"    A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cashunder management also improved profits, James Capel said.    A general improvement in air traffic last year contributedto Cathay's revenue increase, but the company's load factordeclined because of increased competition and an expansion ofits fleet and services.    James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flownlast year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flownclimbed 17 pct, though the airline's load factor probably fellto 68.8 pct from 70 pct.    \"Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routeslast year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,\"said Tsang. \"This affected its load factor.\"    Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier HongKong Dragon Airways Ltd may have contributed to Cathay'sdecision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analystssaid.

Lukman said that some industry reports \"may be correct\" thatin February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mlnallocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.    He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by hiscountry were coming under price pressure because they werecurrently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades andthe United States\" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.    However, he said Opec in December had anticipated thatdemand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasonsand expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.    \"We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market isnow firming on actual fundamentals,\" he said, adding that heexpected it to go \"up and up\" even beyond official prices afterearly April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demandfor gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria\"s.    The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuelaand Indonesia were having less problems with output thanproducers like his own country because they exported oilproducts.    Also, some of Venezuela\"s heavy grades were outside the Opecpricing system, he said.    Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to liftsome Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocksand ran them down to \"dangerous levels,\" they would eventuallyhave to buy Opec oil.    \"When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)they will realise they should buy now instead of paying morelater on,\" he said.    Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was beingpressured by equity producers for better terms, said it wasimportant to know that terms with them were negotiable,flexible and under constant review, not only when the marketseemed weak.    He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nationministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and thatsuch a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priorityfor Opec at the moment.    \"At this time, we have to get our priorities right,\" he said.\"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord isworking, not dealing with a differential of cents betweengrades.\"    But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections overthe differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.

The joint Development Committee, in a communique releasedfollowing day-long discussions, said an improved environmentfor commodities was extremely important to the long-termviability of developing countries.    The committee also criticised the slow-down in lending todebtor nations.    Poorer countries, which rely primarily on raw commoditysales to industrial nations to pay their debts, have beenhighly critical of protectionist agricultural policies in theUnited States, Western Europe and Japan.    \"Ministers identified protectionist agricultural policies asa major cause of distortions including depressed commodityprices on world markets, of surplus production and of budgetarydrain,\" the communique said.    The communique, delayed because of disputes over specificlanguage, was the final statement by the IMF and the bank afterweek-long semi-annual meetings of the two lending agencies.    Earlier, the IMF's powerful Interim Committee added itsvoice to growing criticism of delays by commercial banks oncritically needed loan packages for debt-laden developingcountries.    The committee said it welcomed the exploration of newprocedures and financing techniques that will help mobilise newfinancial support for indebted countries.    On Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, in astatement to the policy-making committee, said commercial banklending to debtor nations last year was disappointing and moreflexibility in loan programs was needed.    \"Doubts about financing can clearly undermine the resolve tocarry out needed reforms,\" Baker said.    The Development Committee also joined in the criticism,noting that there had been a declining flow of capital to thedeveloping countries that \"has been particularly significant inthe case of flows from commercial banks.\"    A number of bank negotiations are bogged down over detailsincluding financial packages for Mexico, Nigeria and Argentina.

General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner andBrown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc.    Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such asGeneral Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution ofthe challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sellthe stations.    GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with WaltDisney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to agroup that challenged the station's license.    GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV inSecaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs.    General Partners said it intends to keep the company'splastics and industrial products businesses and its tires andrelated products segment.    Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, saidthat, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth asmuch as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospacebusiness could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billiondlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs pershare, he said.    The company, formerly known as General Tireand Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would beworth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottlingbusiness might also be worth several dollars per share, hesaid.    Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, whobecame chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company'sAerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over theyears and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve.    \"The management's doing a very fine job in trying to dealwith the non-strategic assets of the company,\" Rose said.    Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, butthey declined to predict what steps the company might take.They said it would be possible the company might consider aleveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer.    General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and therewas some concern about \"greenmail.\" Greenmail is the payment ata premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock.    \"I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothingsurprises me anymore,\" said Rose.    GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retainedFirst Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.    Reuter",

Leigh-Pemberton said in oral evidence to a select committeethat \"we did not swap numbers - we reached an understanding\" onhow to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around theircurrent levels.    He said the accord had brought Britain into a form of jointcurrency float - but one which let it still purse anindependent monetary policy. \"I would concede that, since theLouvre Accord, we are acting as if we are in something,\"Leigh-Pemberton said.    \"The Louvre and Plaza accords show there is a very effectiverole for the (Group of) seven central banks to operate together\"towards stabilising exchange rates,\" Leigh-Pemberton said.    He did not mention this week's intervention by centralbanks to support the dollar, after markets decided to test theaccord.     Leigh-Pemberton said that \"the effectiveness of this(cooperation) is actually larger than many of us had thought inthe pre-Plaza days\" before September 1985.    He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadlysought by the six nations, and noted that \"we are more effectivein our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing.\"    He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadlysought by the six nations, and noted that \"we are more effectivein our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing.\"    Leigh-Pemberton said that, in principle, the Bank ofEngland favoured full EMS membership for sterling, providedsuch a move did not endanger U.K. Anti-inflation monetarypolicy. Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rateslower, he said \"the two half point cuts (this month in banks'base lending rates) have been appropriate up until now.\"    Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a \"cautious step-by-stepapproach\" to reducing short term interest rates, not leastbecause \"we have a potential problem with inflation.\"    Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct, \"oneof the highest\" among industrialised nations, he added.    Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wantedbase rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budgeton March 17, but he said pressure from financial markets forsuch a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10pct.    Regarding sterling's relationship with oil, Leigh-Pembertonsaid that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall.    He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrelmight suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England's sterlingindex, when compared with the index's level before oil pricesdropped from around the 30 dlr level.

            "input": "Japan's plan to cut beef interventionprices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boostdemand because of strict supply controls and a complexdistribution system, Japanese and U.S. Industry sources said.    \"Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meetingconsumers' demands and the cutback ... Is too marginal,\" aHousewives Association of Japan official said.    Despite mounting U.S. Pressure on Japan to open farmmarkets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, whichmaintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers.    Under the plan, expected to be announced this month, thestandard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbledbeef -- will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820.    The standard price of other beef, mainly produced fromdairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceilingat 1,325 against 1,420.    Ministry officials said the semi-government LivestockIndustry Promotion Corp (LIPC) conducts buffer stock operationsto help keep wholesale beef prices within the interventionprice zone.    The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amountset by the government under a quota system. When wholesaleprices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks,both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef whenprices are below.    But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beefstocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.    Phillip Seng, Asian Director of the U.S. Meat ExportFederation, told Reuters the two pct cut in prices is a steptoward closing the gap with European Community prices, abouthalf those in Japan.    But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U.S.Meat exporters because of Japan's rigid and complicateddistribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC.    The Housewives Association official said retail beef pricesare high mainly because of distribution problems and highproduction costs, as well as poor operations by the LIPC.    American meat packers see Japan as a promising market. F.C.Beatty, of U.S. Packer John Morrell and Co, told the JapanTimes beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound inthe U.S., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said this week hewill ask Japan to remove all beef import restrictions when hevisits here next month.    In 1984, Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by9,000 tonnes a year until March 31, 1988.    In 1987/88, the quota will rise to 177,000 tonnes from168,000 in 1986/87, ministry officials said, adding Japan wantsto keep self-sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct. REUTER",

Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be savedand must be felled, Chee Kheng Hoy, Head of the Crop Protectionand Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute ofMalaysia (RRIM), told Reuters.    He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenespora had hit seven pct of Sri Lanka's plantations and may causeoutput to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.    The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institutemay ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by thedisease and added that most estates affected belong to theState Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.    Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affectscertain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and thatfurther use of such clones must be discontinued.

A senior U.S. Treasury official poured cold water on theplan earlier this week, however. \"We are not willing to enterinto arrangements that would forgive debt or provideconcessional interest rates,\" the official said.

Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a newsconference he expected both profit and turnover to rise thisyear compared with 1986, but he said it was questionablewhether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.

Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help theparent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audiwould ensure VW got a share of profits.    Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own freereserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 yearsVW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.

In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products lesscompetitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost ofimported products that are re-exported in different forms.    \"Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather thanhelp, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,\" it said.    The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilkeand Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, whichclimbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shiftingcurrency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.    Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such asforeign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrialcompetitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictionson mergers, added little to the problem, it said.    \"Although each industry's competitiveness affects the levelof imports and exports in that industry, in general we findthat there have been no significant industry-specific changesaffecting competitiveness that would explain the increase inthe overall trade deficit,\" the study said.    \"To the extent any government action is needed to deal withthe trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-widephenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,\"the FTC study said.    Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shiftswere the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the reportsaid it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost somedomestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.    It also said it found a \"fairly direct relationship\" betweenthe increased trade deficit and the influence of shiftingcurrency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domesticdemand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreignconsumer demand.    The study examined seven factors which have been commonlyblamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies andtrade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack ofinvestment in U.S. Industry, declining research and developmentin U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oilprices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.

ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries areready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side thatreopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said.    ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight dayswhen producers and consumers failed to reach agreement.     \"Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions,it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,\"Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must benegotiated sometime, he said.     The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotasbut that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lowerits export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegatessaid.     At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICOboard is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, thereintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and someadministrative matters, according to a draft agenda.    The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president JorioDauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum andchief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending themeeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be anon-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned.    \"I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking amongproducers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposalby September (the next scheduled council meeting),\" BronwynCurtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said.    Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that adate will be set for an earlier council meeting.    If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect thecoffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for theremainder of its life, to September 30, 1989.    When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largestcoffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one anotherfor sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise.    Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares,under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports,but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for sharesto be redistributed using \"objective criteria,\" which would havethreatened Brazil's share.

McIvor, an Exxon Corp XON Director andsenior vice president told Reuters in an interview.    \"Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gapbetween demand and supply will widen so that the trend toincreasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East isinevitable,\" McIvor said.    Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but arenot likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said.    McIvor, Exxon's senior vice president responsible for oiland gas exploration and production said that dependence wouldresult from the Mideast's large spare capacity at a time whenthe rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding.    \"Since 1970 we've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of onlyabout 10-15 bilion barrels per year,\" McIvor said.    \"The bulk of the inventory and more than half of theremaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which isproducing at much less than current capacity,\" he added.    McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discoveredso far only 37 \"one-one thousandth of the total number containedabout 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.\"    McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did notbelieve there were any more \"super giants\", or oil fields withreserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found whichwould change the conclusion of the world's growing dependency.    \"Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the MiddleEast. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20years and only two of these lie outside the middle east(Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska's North Slope).\" McIvor said.    McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S.like Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching apeak and would soon begin to decline.    But the Exxon executive said that there were still plentyof opportunities to be explored and developed outside of theMiddle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, andAustralia and Africa.    McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in thoseareas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higherprice of oil as well as the legal regime affecting thecompanies.    \"The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is aconstant change in policies,\" McIvor said.    McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used toincrease exploration as these only benefit one part of theeconomy at the expense of other parts of the economy.    Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. EnergySecretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said hecould not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowancenow but \"the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It hashighlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and theneed to increase U.S. production.\"    McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play agreater role in the future in meeting energy needs.    \"Natural gas will have the opportunity to become anincreasingly important part of the worlkd's energy supply,\"McIvor said.    \"Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportationfuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as anindustrial fuel,\" he added.

However, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bondfutures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and thecontracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery beforeresuming their decline.    Key to the near-term direction of futures will be thecourse of the dollar, they said.    \"As the dollar goes, so goes the bond market,\" said DeanWitter analyst Karen Gibbs.    The recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year lowagainst the Japanese yen Monday, was reversed Wednesday whenseveral large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised theirprime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct.    \"Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar,foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar declineis over,\" Gibbs said.    The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debtfutures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation.    Indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at themeeting of the Federal Reserve's policy making arm, the FederalOpen Market Committee, this week, analysts said.    \"To the Fed, the combination of a falling dollar, asteepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices looksuspiciously like the traces of expectations of acceleratinginflation,\" said Denis Karnosky, analyst at Carroll, McEnteeand McGinley Inc.    Such expectations could mean that \"a shift in policy towardrestriction of bank reserves is likely to get very seriousconsideration,\" at the FOMC meeting, he said.    Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highlyvisible form of monetary tightening, Karnosky said.    Rather, the key to detecting a change will be found inseasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, hesaid. Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mlndlrs over the past several months, he said.    In the meantime, however, \"the market looks a bitoversold,\" said Jim Wysoglad, analyst at Golden Gate Futures.    Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition coulddrive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to testchart support near the recent low of 97-13/32.

President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruledout a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to helpthe depressed domestic oil industry.

USDA is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, thatwould offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in thecultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishablecommodities.    The department is considering including in its definitionof perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops,Spanish reeds and Christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane,the New York Times reported yesterday.    Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., would like to see thedefinition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of whichis \"a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,\"Gene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said.    Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbyingUSDA hard to have their products covered by the amnestyprovision, farm industry sources said.    Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation saidlivestock producers were \"desperate\" because they fear they willbe unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joinedthat industry.    A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congressdid not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workerswho helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops andSpanish reeds was \"marginal.\"    In addition, lawmakers made it clear during considerationof the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by thethe amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas trees\"a tough call,\" this source said.    USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulationexcept to say it was subject to change before it will bereleased, probably some time later this month.

Such action \"would put a lot of pressure on the Canadianbanks to do the same,\" Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bankanalyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters.    \"They (banks) like to appear to be conservative,\" saidPulcine, \"and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performingbasis and the Canadian banks don't, there is going to be a lotof pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is consideringthe loans non-performing and another bank is not.\"    Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said anywillingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as CiticorpCCI to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather thanlet Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compellingexample for other creditor banks.    \"In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) haveto have the support of the other banks,\" said Meredith.    Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltdsaid at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify,\"wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basisand is trying to encourage the others to take that position.\"    Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrsby Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments onits 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt.    Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 daysbefore declaring loans on which they are receiving no interestas non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days.They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans untillate May, which falls in Canadian banks' third quarter endingJuly 31.    Bank of Montreal, Brazil's largest Canadian bankcreditor, said last week it was not currently consideringdeclaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans asnon-performing.    \"I think that is just for the benefit of the public,\" Walshsaid of Bank of Montreal's statement.     Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadianbanks from a move to declare the Brazilian loansnon-performing.    They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments bythe banks' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banksto recoup their lost interest income.    \"From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the bankswill get the money,\" said Meredith. \"My outlook at this point isoptimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year'searnings.\"    Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of3.80 dlrs for Royal Bank of Canada compared with 3.74 in1986; 4.30 dlrs for Bank of Montreal compared with 3.59; 2.25dlrs for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce compared with2.23;  2.15 dlrs for Bank of Nova Scotia compared with 1.94,and 2.85 dlrs for Toronto Dominion Bank against 2.74.    She forecast 1.90 dlrs for National Bank of Canadaagainst 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split.    Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earningsestimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share,assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil's interest costs.    \"If the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of thefiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts ashare. But I don't see that as a likely scenario,\" Pulcine said.

Talk among futures traders that cattle had died from thecold and blowing snow accounted for some of the strength inLive Cattle futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange today.    \"Death (of cattle) can be directly attributed to the storm,but it's hard to get a handle on a number,\" Todd Domer,director of communications for the Kansas Livestock Associationsaid.    Domer noted that limited reports have been filtering in ofdeath losses at feedyards and from grazing and cow/calfoperations. Western Kansas was hardest hit while Eastern Kansasonly had rain, he said.    Paul Johnston of the Nebraska Livestock Feeders Associationsaid, \"There's no question that baby calves coming in that kindof blizzard are probably not going to make it.\"    We were having such a nice winter and the cows were outcalving before the storm hit, he added.    The worst part of the storm came through the center of thestate. Precipitation was generally in the form of wet snow andsome feedlots are already like \"soup\", he said, inhibitingcattle movements.    The storm also had an effect on weight gain of largeranimals. Drifting snow caused problems in moving feed and mudmade it hard for cattle to reach the feed once it wasavailable.    Domer noted that feedyards sources say a tremendous cutbackhas occurred in feed consumption by cattle in the yards, whichmay or may not lead to sickness over the next several days.Cattle reduced daily feed consumption to about 12 lbs from 25during the worst of the blizzard, he said.    Mud will be more a problem as the weather breaks and snowmelts. Mud adds to stress on full-grown animals and endangerssmaller ones which can fall and be trampled in pens. The costof feeding rises as animals generally consume more in coldweather, Domer said.    Domer said it will be at least 10 days before yards getback to normal.    Roy Gallant, from Accu Weather Services, said that althoughthe worst of the storm is over, there are still some stronggusty winds which will not diminish until tonight.    The storm started late Sunday night in West Kansas and isjust now winding down. The storm has moved into South Dakota,parts of Minnesota and Eastern North Dakota, he said.    Snow accumulations from the storm totaled six to 10 inchesin most sections and 12 to 18 in a few spots before movingnorth. This equals 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches of water. Drifts of fourto six feet and up to 12 feet were reported, he said.    There's a possibility of another storm brushing that regiontomorrow night and Friday, Gallant added. Reuter",

Accusing the French of overfishing, Canada yesterday saidthat any French fishermen caught in the Burgeo Bank area, offthe south coast of Newfoundland, would be arrested.    \"The French government strongly protests against the closingof Canadian ports to French fishing vessels and against thefishing ban decided by canada on the Burgeo Bank,\" the ministrystatement added.    The French foreign ministry said the measure, the latestepisode in the long-running fishing dispute, would have anegative effect on fishing negotiations currently held betweenOttawa and Paris.    Canada is claiming the French have exceeded their6,400-tonne quota of cod allowed in the area.    In January Canada and France concluded an interim fishingaccord, opposed by fishermen in both countries, allowing Franceto increase its cod quota by about 15,000 tonnes during 1987.    Under this accord, Canada and France also agreed to referdifferences over a maritime boundary zone near the Frenchislands of Saint-Pierre et Miquelon to internationalarbitration. Reuter",
