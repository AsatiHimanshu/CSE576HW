If present trends continue, the world will be about 4 degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990 but 11 degrees colder in the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age.\"\n\nEnvironmental activist Stephen Schneider told Discover magazine in 1989: \"We have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have. ...

Dr. Williams has gathered a considerable amount of unimpeachable evidence in his research of Hawaii's history surrounding the \"overthrow\". The evidence proves that the members of the Committee of Safety were blatant and unapologetic white supremacist racists who believed that, as a non-whites, Hawaiians were inferior subhumans that were incapable of governing themselves, despite having done so for thousands of years, and that they needed white men to govern over them.\n\nThis attitude is typical of the white supremacist racist ideology upon which America was founded.",

The fact that there were good people working within this system trying (usually far from successfully) to secure food and clothing for the children in spite of terrible underfunding, or to make up for the inadequate training and predatory activity of staff (almost always without reporting anything to police), does not matter.\n\nSo many cultures with histories of violence and trauma try to smooth over the violence with \"Yes, but ...\" narratives, as if to protect reputations of the people responsible, but this simply keeps denial afloat.\n\nAnd that's how the denial becomes accepted as truth, and chances of real reconciliation simply rot on the vine.",

Yes, almost any health complaint is over diagnosed and sometimes over treated out of fear of missing something and winding up in Court.

The housing boom and resulting bubble was created by Bill Clinton. Bush did not understand or see this sub prime bubble.

I worked at San Juan Regional Hospital in Farmington NM and the tribes there had a tendency to embarrass a woman if she told anyone she was raped. It was an embarrassment to her and it was something she should be quiet about. If she told anyone she was a disgrace but the man wasn't. I worked on a woman who was so badly raped we had to do a hysterectomy to save her life. She was obviously raped but wouldn't go through the tribal arrest system. Unfortunately other societies such as the Japanese and middle eastern are similar to this but this COULD (MIGHT POSSIBLY, I DON'T KNOW) create a worse situation for these women.",

Carry the chains in the trunk along with a pair of winter gloves and a piece of plastic to lie on.  Practice putting the chains on in your driveway before you leave.  Get them as tight as possible and then tighten them again after a km or two.  Having a couple of bungee cords to stretch across the face of the wheel to pull the cables tight helps also.

By having a fairly high percentage, it discourages schools from spending outrageous amounts of money on coach's pays and huge facilities.
