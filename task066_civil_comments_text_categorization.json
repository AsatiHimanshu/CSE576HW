Skin on his head, arms and legs had been ripped off, and there were tears on his skeletal muscles.\" The dogs have been released back into their owners custody and NO CHARGES have been filed against the owners. The prosecutor asserts that since it cant be PROVEN Aliado didnt provoke the dogs theres no basis to pursue charges.

If a teacher has been assigning something like this for 20 years, there's no point in \"confronting her directly\". If her supervisor comes up with the line that defends her free-range, earth-friendly snobbery was \"a joke\", there's no reason to talk to anyone at the school about this assignment (clearly the entire administration sees the mind-numbing cognitive dissonance in labeling a cake full of sugar \"earth friendly\" and \"cruelty free\"). Leak it to the WW, and see what happens: Lo and behold, suddenly the creativity-loving food snob changes her tune.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with advocating for creativity (though I personally am skeptical of elementary school creativity proselytizers). There's absolutely nothing wrong with using and advocating \"earth friendly\" and \"human healthy\" ingredients.  But a middle school teacher - even one who lives in Portland - has no credentials to know what these ingredients are, and no right to push parents of her students to make financial lifestyle decisions based on the teacher's personal moral stance on branding and labeling of chicken and wheat products.

When calculating UCR, they do one blanket price STATEWIDE for each procedure.

At least the mayor of Houston, Alaska had the long-term vision to see the benefits of MJ sales in her town. And everyone will have to pass through Wasilla to get to Houston to buy weed.

Some leadership within the City of Salem wants to build an extra bridge over the Willamette River to alleviate peak hour congestion.  This would only cost $400 million, and it would be paid for with a property tax levy (among many other sources).  We are also gearing up to spend about $48 million to widen about one mile of I-5 (at the south end of Salem).  When one looks at how much money gets dumped into our roads (yet it is still not enough!) I am amazed that people get so upset with other solutions.
